Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels.

Obviously it's wonderful to be able to open a bottle of wine and have it stay good for a day or two, especially if you just like one glass with dinner. This lets you open up and enjoy more expensive wine since you won't waste the whole rest of the bottle. If you are interested in learning about wines, you'll probably want to open up 2 or more wines at a time to compare them, and this way you won't waste anything. The wine saver will keep the undrunk portion until the next time.  I do recommend putting the bottle in the fridge if you don't drink it the next day. Just pull the bottle out an hour before you want to drink it if it's red.\",\n",

Prior to buying VacuVin, my red wine bottles would last a maximum of 1-2 days if immediately re-corked, and white wine a few days longer if refrigerated.  Now, my red wine is good for up to a week, and the white wine lasts even longer.  The device is very simple - it pumps air through a plastic cork to re-create the original pressure prior to opening.  Simple to use, and the corks are easy to rinse.  Perfect for single people like me who don't want to drink a full bottle in one sitting, or who may switch from red one night to white the next.\",\n",

I used to overpump just to make sure the wine-damaging oxygen was out of the bottle.<p>I got this model in Napa a few months ago and I'm glad I did.  While it doesn't deliver on its Concerto promise, it does give you reassuring clicks when a vacuum has been reached, enabling you to stop pumping sooner.  It's a nice refinement.<p>The only downside over the previous model is that it won't work with the marinating device sold separately because the bottom is configured differently from the earlier model.\",\n",

And the hues are beautiful and distinctive. The black and red, two colors which are very difficult to get when dying frostings, etc. are especially nice - probably the best of any manufacturer I have tried.<p>For those who had questions, I am not 100% certain about the sizes, but if the set is the same as mine, the bottles are 3/4 ounce. While that might not seem like much, all you need is a dot of this thick gel paste at the end of a toothpick to color large amounts of material. So there is plenty of coloring ability in each bottle - many, many times more than a same sized liquid food color bottle. <p>Highly recommended and at a really good price at the time of this review.',\n",

       " 'Finally, a collection of the best Camper Van Beethoven albums (I think there is one album missing from the band, a  major label release with intentionally clean over-production).  I had been waiting years for this dream CD, as I only possessed each one in vinyl.  <p>Some people like to listen to a full album that has a recognizable identity in its sonic experience.  You will not get that from Camper, as they instead offer a faint, mysterious familiarity in musical pieces that can tweak your ears in two opposing directions, even during the simplist compositions.  If that sounds appealling, you can correctly guess that boredom cannot maintain a presence with this compilation.<p>Categorizing this music is impossible, again due to so many style changes.  Psycho-country?  Unpretentious garage-rock with arena-sized talent?  Low-fi Hillbilly Jazz?  Spraycan Art-rock?  Gritty Underground Surf? Poor rich kids with Mischievous Aspirations transferring their energy into music? Kerouac whack?  How about calling it a \"Flexible Soup\".  It\\'s anything but smooth, yet occassionally you find David Lowery\\'s penchant for small club-guitar rock sneaking through (after CVB dismantled, he became the leader of the successful pop-rock group, Cracker).  It may be easier to instead think of the band as a group of hyper-static fellows whose medications are almost, but not quite at the right dosage.  They\\'re simply possessed by friendly demons with a spiritual intent to entertain and cause wonder. <p>Each album collectively draws numerous inspirations and styles, completely entertaining the listener through lyrics and musicianship on a variety of traditional and obscure instruments.  One can only imagine the pure enjoyment the band had while first writing then performing these before an audience.  For two decades now, I\\'ve held a relentless belief that CVB would make the most amusing backyard-party band -- sure to make Granmma Nelly dance alongside her pierced third generation of family one moment and then cover her bleeding ears when the next song begins.  However, I believe the band\\'s intent is not to frighten or shock, but to instead expose the wealth of musical styles that one listener despises while another reaches a glee plateau.  Be sure that these same two listeners will switch positions when a later tune begins.  Are you prepared to enjoy the best of many worlds?<p>Picturesque landscapes are lyrically drawn with a slacker-like intelligence in unimportant poignancy, the next moment you are drawn into a global hoe-down, followed then by crafty psychedelica mixed with raw instrumentals, closing with an guitar orchestra jamout with lead played by a screaming violin chant.  Add a half-tablespoon of sugar Wiseguy and serve.  <p>Add this to your collection if you appreciate bands that are like no other.  Some tracks will prompt you to ask \"Why?\", yet with an immediate second thought you\\'ll smile and say \"Why hasn\\'t Anyone Else?\"<p>[I noticed that CVB had recently made a handful of live performances after a long time apart.  I\\'ve caught several of their shows and recommend all to give your mind a jolt of electricity that is surprisingly pleasant.  You will walk away wide-eyed at the unrealized potential and wasted energy we swallow in 99% of today\\'s music. ]',\n",

You will not get that from Camper, as they instead offer a faint, mysterious familiarity in musical pieces that can tweak your ears in two opposing directions, even during the simplist compositions.  If that sounds appealling, you can correctly guess that boredom cannot maintain a presence with this compilation.<p>Categorizing this music is impossible, again due to so many style changes.  Psycho-country?  Unpretentious garage-rock with arena-sized talent?  Low-fi Hillbilly Jazz?  Spraycan Art-rock?  Gritty Underground Surf? Poor rich kids with Mischievous Aspirations transferring their energy into music? Kerouac whack?  How about calling it a \"Flexible Soup\".  It\\'s anything but smooth, yet occassionally you find David Lowery\\'s penchant for small club-guitar rock sneaking through (after CVB dismantled, he became the leader of the successful pop-rock group, Cracker).  It may be easier to instead think of the band as a group of hyper-static fellows whose medications are almost, but not quite at the right dosage.  They\\'re simply possessed by friendly demons with a spiritual intent to entertain and cause wonder. <p>Each album collectively draws numerous inspirations and styles, completely entertaining the listener through lyrics and musicianship on a variety of traditional and obscure instruments.  One can only imagine the pure enjoyment the band had while first writing then performing these before an audience.  For two decades now, I\\'ve held a relentless belief that CVB would make the most amusing backyard-party band -- sure to make Granmma Nelly dance alongside her pierced third generation of family one moment and then cover her bleeding ears when the next song begins.  However, I believe the band\\'s intent is not to frighten or shock, but to instead expose the wealth of musical styles that one listener despises while another reaches a glee plateau.  Be sure that these same two listeners will switch positions when a later tune begins.  Are you prepared to enjoy the best of many worlds?<p>Picturesque landscapes are lyrically drawn with a slacker-like intelligence in unimportant poignancy, the next moment you are drawn into a global hoe-down, followed then by crafty psychedelica mixed with raw instrumentals, closing with an guitar orchestra jamout with lead played by a screaming violin chant.  Add a half-tablespoon of sugar Wiseguy and serve.  <p>Add this to your collection if you appreciate bands that are like no other.  Some tracks will prompt you to ask \"Why?\", yet with an immediate second thought you\\'ll smile and say \"Why hasn\\'t Anyone Else?\"<p>[I noticed that CVB had recently made a handful of live performances after a long time apart.  I\\'ve caught several of their shows and recommend all to give your mind a jolt of electricity that is surprisingly pleasant.  You will walk away wide-eyed at the unrealized potential and wasted energy we swallow in 99% of today\\'s music. ]',\n",

It took some effort finding their back catalog on lp, but was even harder for me to find II &amp; III and the self-titled album on cd.

Generally light and mild tasting, but that will depend upon how long you steep it and if you add a sweetener of some form.<p>Interesting too, are the amusing comments and remarks that appear on the packaging. Reading through this as you drink your tea makes it a distinctive experience. I never seen tea so clever!

       " \"Few things I'd like to point out:<p>1.  &quot;Espresso&quot; is not a roast.  It's a drink.  In northern Italy they make espresso from Vienna roast, in southern Italy they use French.  Starbucks appears to be using French roast, so they should just label it French roast like any normal person would.<p>2.  The product description says &quot;Taste Espresso Roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. This is one versatile coffee!&quot;  This is patently absurd.  It's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  Here's why:<p>Making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  Making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  If you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  If you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  You get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.<p>Therefore, a &quot;Universal Grind&quot; is an impossibility.  They should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.<p>3.  It's over-roasted.  Starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  Then they roast all their beans Vienna or French.  Most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not Vienna or French.  So why roast all your beans too dark?  I guess it's just easier that way.  Also, it lets them rename Vienna Roast as &quot;Starbucks Roast&quot; because the Austrians don't seem to care.<p>That said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - Starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.<p>Anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:<p>Buy a grinder.  Nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  If you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  If you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  Amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  It's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for Starbucks you should invest in one.<p>Find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  Freshness matters!  Good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.<p>Ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  Most people don't use the right amount.  If you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  Not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.\",\n",

       " \"Red beans and rice is such a simple dish.  Everybody in New Orleans eats it on Mondays, from cab drivers and port workers to businesspeople and Tulane kids.<p>New Orleaneans (native or adopted, displaced or otherwise) know that red beans and rice is a very subtle dish.  The beans at Dunbar's, Mother's, and Ye Olde College Inn (all famous for the dish) are all different, and everybody's mother has her own recipe, too.  There are many variables involved in getting it to come out just right, from the choice of meat to the number of bay leaves to add to the pot.  <p>The most important is in choosing beans.  Red beans and rice cooked by displaced New Orleaneans elsewhere doesn't always come out as creamy as people in the city are used to--often they're thick and starchy and the beans need to be put in a blender to get anything resembling the gravy in the authentic dish.  One reason for this is that Americans outside of New Orleans and the Deep South really don't eat beans, red or otherwise, and the beans sit on the shelf and toughen.  The second reason is that the &quot;red kidney bean&quot; popular in New Orleans is not the same thing as the kidney bean used in three-bean salad or Texas chili.  It's smaller, hence it cooks faster, gets creamier faster, and has a more intense color and flavor.<p>Camellia beans are authentic Louisiana red beans--the small variety--and they're probably the most popular in New Orleans.  They enjoy such a good reputation because they're almost invariably fresh and they produce the creamy pot of beans that, more than any other dish, reminds us of New Orleans.\",\n",

This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land.<br /><br />Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine.<br /><br />The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix.

A classic is romaine lettuce, gorgonzola and apple slices.<p>In contrast, gouda is a milder creamy cheese, great for breads. If cheddar were a starting point, I would say gouda is more creamy.

Their flavor is very light and seasoning is needed but this is a plus for me as I can season to taste.<p>I have also mixed these with traditional bread crumbs at times as these tend to be expensive for a lighter style coating but still essentially very much like all panko dishes.  I tend to use a light egg wash with these as I find using just eggs to dip the meat/poulty/fish in a bit heavy for these crumbs.  <p>In general I find these far superior for coating food.

Brown the onion and chicken.  Add 3-4 cups of water and the potatoes and carrots.  Cook for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are done.  Remove from heat and add the Golden Curry (cut it into pieces for easier melting).  Mix well and it's soooooo tasty!  Serve over rice or udon noodles.  5 servings?

       " '\"Sitting on the porch of a bungalow on a tea plantation in Darjeeling, you can see the peaks of Everest and Kanchenjunga as you sip a cup of this exquisite brew. Life is good.\" ~tea packet<br /><br />If you want a subtle tea with a smooth, soothing flavor, then Darjeeling is an excellent choice. The slightly floral flavor is much milder than an Earl Grey. I especially love this blend when eating a Caramel Apple Cobbler Clif Bar. For some reason, the flavors mingle nicely. I think it is the slightly nutty flavor of the Darjeeling.<br /><br />While many of the Tazo teas are blends of a variety of teas, this tea is purely a blend of Organic Black Darjeeling teas. The tea is grown near India\\'s border with Bhutan. There are only \"true Darjeeling\" tea leaves in this tea.<br /><br />This tea is just perfect when blended with an Organic Sucanat: Natural Sugar Cane. You might also want to try using \"milk powder\" instead of cold milk with your tea. I find it helps to keep the tea strength and adds a creamy element to the smoothness of this tea.<br /><br />Darjeeling is a very satisfying blend for morning tea. You might also enjoy AWAKE and Earl Grey if you enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I just love the packaging of the Tazo Teas. The individual wrappings have a nice crinkly sound and the colors are all so soothing and quite beautiful. These teas are definitely for the aesthetically aware. Drinking Tazo teas literally becomes a magical experience. There is something mysterious going on here. The teas even seem to have a magical glint or luster to them. When you drink Tazo teas the world looks more beautiful and you feel much more aware of life itself. I find that my creativity soars after drinking Tazo teas.<br /><br />For more information on the mysteries of Tazo Tea, read the review for the Tazo Assorted Teas.<br /><br />For a calming experience try the Tazo Calm Herbal Infusion which is perfect for quiet evenings, after completing a yoga workout or just to sip on while you write in<br />your journal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review',\n",

       " 'Organic Sucanat is many levels above regular white granulated sugar. This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure.<br /><br />When holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the  \"dark brown sugar\" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue.<br /><br />Recently I\\'ve been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy.<br /><br />This is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar.<br /><br />Sucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is \"green cut.\" This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium.<br /><br />If you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking.<br /><br />If you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can\\'t be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review',\n",

Half-way through its making, he didn't know how it was going to end. The stop-motion techniques might look a little dated but Burton was a big fan of Godzilla as a child.\",\n",

It has a rich, full-bodied flavor, neither bitter nor astringent. The Senseo coffee machine can make 1 4 oz cup, 2 4 oz cups, or a single 8 oz cup at a time. The self-contained pods use a tea bag filter-type paper and are approximately 2&quot; in diameter.<p>Right now, the price averages 25 cents per 4 ounce cup.

The green papery pods are broken open, and the dark seeds inside can be pulled out and ground in a mortar for use in breads, cookies, curries, puddings, chai and the like. It is the spice of &quot;kheer&quot;--Indian rice pudding, where sometimes the whole green pods are thrown in. I use it in tea or even coffee, bruising the black seeds slightly with the pestle. It is also commonly used in pilau (pilaf) or biryani, that festive Indian rice and meat or vegetable cassarole. Scandinavian cooking uses this spice in many cookies and cakes. <p>If you aren't used to the flavor, it can be a bit startling--not sweet and spicey like cinnamon or nutmeg.

       " \"Having received some Blue D'Auvergne along with several other artisan cheeses this Xmas, I was very pleased with the smoothness of this Blue. Unlike the more famous roquefort, D'Auvergne is slightly milder, with less of an after-flavor.  It does not overpower one's tastes and is a good choice for those looking for the strength of a french Bleu but wishing to avoid offending delicate palettes.  <p>This cheese is made from Sheep's Milk and contains the famed veins of blueish bacteria that give the cheese its signature flavor. This Blue was not wet nor sticky as many of the trendier Blues of late seem to have become. Neither has it the overly dry texture of say an English Blue Stilton, a traditional holiday Blue cheese on its own or in combination with the English Gloucster Cheddar and referred to as &quot;Huntsman&quot; cheese, whcih is very pretty, but suitable only as a dessert cheese or for afternoon Tea owing to its dryness.<p>Blue D'Auvergne, on the other hand, has a subtle creamy texture without being overly moist. Some Bleus err on the side of moistness now to the point of being more similar to a triple-creme.  Not so this Bleu. D'Auvergne slices well with the proper cutlery and can be crumbled if you'd like it that way.  It melted well atop a pear tart we made and complimented the sandy sweetness of the pears wtihout overpowering their delicate flavor &amp; scent as a Bleu such as Roquefort would have easily done.  This is a fine addition to the French Bleus and it was a pleasure to have on hand at a time when rich foods were bieng served and the D'Auvergne could be used to sprinkle atop a lightly seared Filet mignon with a sultana reduction sauce or tossed into a simple salad of dandilion greens, leftover crushed walnuts,and nasturtium vinegrette. The possibilities are endless.<p>This cheese was not too rich but was just rich enough to enhance any dish it graced. It's light tang was never overpowering, rather it added a gentle dash of excitment to the foods with which we paired it.

       " \"After spending 2 weeks in the Netherlands last year, I was hooked on Douwe Egberts coffee and found one place in all of Dallas/Ft. Worth that sold it. Finally! America gets Senseo! The coffee I woke up to for 2 weeks and loved. The medium and dark roast are my favorites. Douwe Egbert is excellent coffee. Once you've tasted this high quality Dutch coffee, you'll never go back to American/Columbian nor that burnt stuff sold in those bookstores. Hopefully prices for the coffee will come down. For now, it's cheaper for my friend to ship me Senseo coffee from Holland (package of 18 pads there is less than 2 Euro) than to buy it here in the States or online. Now I will celebrate SENSEO DAY, the day I received my Senseo machine (tho it arrived without the free coffee cups) every year!\",\n",

It is perfect for the people who are bored with regular hot sauces. Nothin compares to this fabulous hot sauce. I put it on everything. It'll add spice and flavor to any dish or put it directly on food. I'm not sure that it is reccomended to put it directly on food, but I do it and love it. If you think you've tried every hot sauce and think you can handle the heat, then you should try Dave's to proove yourself wrong! I love Dave's Insanity Sauce!!!!\",\n",
       " '\"We use and believe in stone milling because no machinery has yet been developed that grinds grains into flours, cereals, and meals quite as well as the flint-hard quartz stones used by master millers since early Roman times.\" ~Bob\\'s Red Mill Site<br /><br />The 100 % Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour is my favorite flour for use in a variety of whole wheat bread recipes. It is all natural and doesn\\'t contain any preservatives. You can use this flour for bread machine baking too and it produces superior results. I\\'ve used the recipe on the back of the bag and adapted it by using a mixture of whole wheat and regular bread flour because I didn\\'t have any \"gluten\" as called for in the recipe. If you substitute 1 Â½ cups of regular bread flour for part of the whole wheat flour you don\\'t seem to need the gluten.<br /><br />Bob\\'s Red Mill products remind me of my childhood when my father took me to the Graue Mill in Oakbrook, IL where we watched corn being milled. It is now the only operating waterwheel gristmill in Illinois. While Bob\\'s Red Mill products don\\'t arrive in a cloth bag, the paper bags do have an old fashioned feel and have a string-sewn closure. I love the crinkly sound of the high-quality paper bags.<br /><br />Bob\\'s Red Mill uses slow turning, 100-year-old millstones to naturally grind together the bran, endosperm and germ that contains the nutritious oil. This is a \"cool stone grinding process\" which preserves nutrients normally lost in high-speed, high-heat milling.<br /><br />This company produces more than 400 products. Look for everything from hot cereals and mixes to flour milled from a wide variety of grains. If you love making natural breads in your bread machine, the flours are superior and produce deliciously nutritious breads.<br /><br />Whole Wheat Oat Rolls<br /><br />1 c. water, warmed to 110Â°F<br />5 T. fat-free milk powder<br />2 T. clover honey<br />2 T. salted butter, melted<br />2 1/2 tsp. active dry yeast<br />1 lg. egg<br />2 c. bread flour<br />1 c. Bob\\'s Red Mill whole-wheat flour<br />1/2 c. Bob\\'s Red Mill thick-rolled oats<br />2 T. wheat germ<br />1 1/2 tsp. salt<br />Melted butter<br />Oats<br /><br />The dough may be made in a bread machine or by hand. Bread machine method: Place the water, milk powder, honey, melted butter, yeast, egg, bread<br />flour, whole-wheat flour, oats, wheat germ and salt into a bread machine pan. Set bread machine for whole wheat, dough and large loaf cycle. Form rolls.<br />Hand method: In a large bowl, whisk the water, milk powder, honey, melted butter, yeast and egg. In an extra large bowl, mix the flour, whole wheat flour,<br />oats, wheat germ and salt. Stir in the yeast mixture.<br /><br />Place dough on a well-floured breadboard. Knead until smooth and elastic. Place in an oiled bowl, turn once, then cover with a damp cloth. Turn oven on to 200Â°F, when you can feel the heat on your hand, turn the oven off. Place bowl in the warm oven and let the dough rise until double.<br /><br />Punch the dough down and cut into 16 pieces. Form rolls then brush with melted butter. Sprinkle the tops of the rolls with the oats. Let rise for 45 minutes or until double then bake in a preheated 400Â°F oven 10-15 minutes or until lightly browned.<br /><br />Makes 16 rolls<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review',\n",

       " \"Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares.

I was suprised to see Ass Kickin' Cajun Hot Sauce on the shelf, and from looking at the name I guessed it would be hot. Well, after trying it on a burrito, I can say it is not that hot. And the bottle only lets you put a drop on at a time. I spent more time trying to get hot sauce out than eating. And since it was not as hot as I wanted, I kept putting more and more on tyring to get some heat which lead to another problem- the taste of vinigar was too strong. Too bad, I was looking forward for something really hot. I guess I will have to wait for my internet order to come it. For those of you who eat tobasco, this is better than tobasco and has a little more heat. For those of you who want very hot, look elsewhere.\",\n",

       " \"If you get this sauce for the first time, I would take a edge of a toothpick and dip it in the sauce, and get the smallest amount on your tounge. It will burn for a good 10 minutes. This will let you know exactly how hot this sauce is. While I would bet most people use this sauce as an additive in other foods like salsa or chili, I like to put it on burittos (the football sized ones from mexican resturants), about one drop every third bite. But if you eat it that way, be prepared to pay the price. Your mouth will burn with no relief in sight. Your sinuses will clear and your nose will run uncontrollably. Your eyes may turn red, and you might have a hard time breathing. And don't forget about that second burn, the next time you use the toilet (that is a serious warning. I was at a mexican resturant with a friend who ate dave's on his burrito. Dave's kicked in and he had to go. Everyone in the resturant could hear him howling in pain while he was in the bathroom). I only know of one other person who can eat the sauce as a sauce. Everyone else who has tried it has begged for an ambulance or help. It is that hot. And I love it.<p>One other note. If you use it as an additive, a little will crank up the heat level of most foods. If you don't think the hot salsa from the grocery store is hot, a few drops of this will make that salsa much hotter. But do yourself a favor, and make your own salsa. It is easy. I chop up two jalepenjo peppers, a onions, a can of diced tomatoes, maybe subsitute a chipolte if i want more sweetness, the juice of a lime, and a dash of dave's. Salt it and let it sit in the fridge for an hour. After an hour, drain the liquid into the blender, and add in one more can of canned tomatoes. Blend it, and then add it back to the salsa mixing it up. For something different, chop up a bit of mint for the salsa. It will give an odd taste. Your mouth will burn as you breath out, and cool as you breath in.\",\n",

       " 'You have heard the story about how the Baby Ruth candy bear was not named for Babe Ruth but for Ruth Cleveland, daughter of President Grover Cleveland.  Well, sorry to disappoint you, but that story is not true.  The first Baby Ruth bars were made by the Curtiss Candy Company, which was founded in Chicago in 1916 by Otto Schnering, who used his mother\\'s maiden name since it was much more American-sounding and would not cause the problems that a German surname would during World War I.  The first confection made by Curtiss was the Kandy Kate, which featured a pastry center topped with nuts and coated with chocolate.  Then in 1921 revised the product so that was now a log-shaped bar made of caramel and peanuts, covered in chocolate.  Priced at only five cents, half the cost of competing candy bars, Schnering named it the Baby Ruth bar, which soon became one of the hottest selling candies on the market.<br /><br />Now, the explanation that the candy bar was named for \"Baby\" Ruth Cleveland, the former President\\'s first-born daughter, has been the official explanation proffered by the Curtiss Candy Company since the 1920\\'s while the Babe Ruth legend has been the obvious explanation, especially since Ruth had joine the Yankees in 1920 and in 1921, the year the Baby Ruth debuted, he hit a then-record 59 home runs.  However, the idea that the Baby Ruth bar was named after Ruth Cleveland is rather morbid given she died of diptheria at the age of 12 in 1904, seventeen years before the candy bar was named.<br /><br />The more reasonable explanation seems that the Curtiss Candy Company did indeed find a way to link their product to the Yankee slugger who was becoming the most famous person in the country.  Ironically, Curtiss had to fight off a challenge from a competitor who was attempting to market the Babe Ruth Home Run Bar, endorsed by the Babe himself.  The Curtiss claim that the bar was named for Ruth Cleveland was enough to fight off the challenge, since the names were too close to one another to allow the new product to be marketed that way.  The fact that Curtiss maintained for years that the Baby Ruth bar came out before years before Babe Ruth became famous is enough to pop the balloon since in 1920 Ruth had broken his single season home run record of 29 by hitting 54 round trippers.<br /><br />Of course all that matters now is that this is still a classic American candy bar.  Beneath the milk chocolate coating of Nestles popular 2.1 ounce candy bar is a chewy, peanut-covered center, wrapped in a nougat that is really more of a white or blonde fudge.  In terms of caloric ration the Baby Ruth is 46% Carbs, 48% Fats, and 6% Protein.  The candy bar is low in Sodium and very low in Cholesterol, which is good, but high in Saturated Fat, which is supposedly bad (where do people think the taste comes from?).  A large portion of the calories come from the sugars, which is how nature intended it.  If you want a candy bar with actual peanuts in it, the Baby Ruth is still a good choice.<br /><br />Ironically, I did find a Champion Cocker Spaniel named Baby Ruth, whelped in 1892, who was in all probability actually named for President Cleveland\\'s daughter, Ruth, who had been the first child to be born in the White House the previous year.  She was bred by Joseph Smith of Canada and sold to Andrew Laidlaw and became the foundation on which Mepal built one of the strongest kennels in the United States.  All three Best in Show Cocker Spaniels at the Westminster Dog Show could trace their pedigree back to this particular Baby Ruth.',\n",

At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.\",\n",

Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor.\",\n",
       " \"Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen.

       " \"I find the best way to rate hot sauces on heat is to compare them to other sauces. This is just slightly hotter than Dave's Insanity Sauce, but slightly less heat than Mad Dog Inferno. It is way hotter than any tobaso product. If tobaso is the only hot sauce you have eaten, I would suggest eating something more mild than Blair's. Sudden Death will give a good burn to just about anyone but the most serious chili heads. <p>What I like about this sauce the most is the flavor. It is very good. Unlike some of the extract sauces which lack flavor, I found this one to taste very good. And it has the heat kick that many of the better tasting sauces do not have.\",\n",

I eat Dave's Insanity Sauce and have no problem with the heat, as a matter of fact I asked the salesperson for something hotter because I was getting used to eating very hot foods. I eat Blair's Sudden Death Sauce and think it has good heat. But Da Bomb was easily so much hotter than those two it burned my tounge like nothing else I have tried. I found myself by the kitchen sink washing my mouth with water. For those who eat tobasco, move on, this is like asking for car battery acid. But for those who are eating habanero's and think Dave's is mild, then this might be what you are looking for.\",\n",

       " 'After a weekend of having my new Senseo coffee maker I can report that it is a delight. I certainly do not consider myself a connoisseur of coffee, but spending on average $30 a week at Starbucks makes me at least an average coffee consumer.<br /><br /> To agree with other reviewers, the taste is not comparable to a freshly-made Starbucks. The Senseo is what it is-a home coffee maker under $70. Starbucks not only controls every element of the process, but uses significantly more sophisticated equipment. Importantly, the Senseo is worth the money.<br /><br /> As a work-at-home businessperson I enjoy having a fresh cup on my desk. The frothy result of the Senseo simulates a latte when you add hot milk to the final cup of coffee. (Never put milk in the Senseo!)<br /><br /> The dark roast is my favorite, but I find that I have to switch to the medium roast decaf after the first cup to keep from bouncing off the walls.<br /><br /> As I said, it will not equally substitue for a fresh Starbucks, but it is fast, enjoyable and easy to use.

The collective eventually grew on me and that was around the time when their first CD Minologue came out. Shoot forward four years, and along comes Colours. This CD is pimp. It is much more dance-friendly in my opinion than other things Son Kite have created. While Minologue was flat-out psychedelic trance, Colours ventures out into different genres. I can hear tidbits of progressive house, epic trance, and even a jazzy feel in these nine songs. Personal favorites include Jukebox, Games and Watch, and Focus. <p>I recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of somewhat underground dance music.',\n",

She dives in and tears it apart - she would work on it non-stop if I didn't periodically take it away from her.  The meat and tendons are harmless enough - obviously they have fat and protein so they have to be tied into diet considerations, and the bone appears to hold onto the flavor long after it's stripped (she still licks and gnaws on a bone that's a few weeks bare).  The knuckles, once they get torn off, should probably be thrown away after a few minutes because they are small enough to be swallowed and/or choked on.  The only downside to this product is when she comes up to me and the whiskers around her mouth are a little discolored and she smells like roasted meat.

       " \"According to its makers, Cholula has been available in Mexico for three generations and imported to the U.S. for about 12 years. Named after a region of Mexico known for its ruins and ancient sites, Cholula is quickly becoming a hot sauce staple in the U.S. The bottle is a classic, with the yellow label, picture of a woman, and wood cap (the wood contains a plastic cap so that the sauce won't be contaminated).<br /><br /> The main ingredient of Cholula is the piquin pepper (also sometimes spelled &quot;pequin&quot;), which is a dried chile with the formal name &quot;capsicum annuum.&quot; In terms of flavor, Cholula is definitely distinctive. The dried chiles add a slightly smoky essence with more dimension than Tabasco or similar hot sauces. The heat level is fairly moderate, which allows the sauce to season your food while not overwhelming it. However, the sauce sometimes seems a little watery or bland.<br /><br /> Cholula adds great flavor to a variety of foods, although I like it best on scrambled eggs; a plethora of recipes are available on the official website. With only 20mg of sodium per teaspoon, Cholula is one of the best sauces available for persons trying to avoid sodium. However, it may taste a bit plain to persons who enjoy a high salt content in their hot sauce.\",\n",
       " \"My cat loved these! But, I don't know how he ever enjoyed them - he just swallows them whole! Not a tooth mark in any of them so he didn't really get to enjoy the gooey centers.  But, he really liked them otherwise and chewed a couple here and there.  They're really small so if your cat has a small mouth, then this one would be a good choice.  I have to buy these for my cat's bad teeth and he really appreciates them! They do a good job in keeping his teeth clean so I don't have to brush them so often.  Love that!\",\n",
       " \"If your cat loves poultry and ground food, this is a great one.  My previous cat loved this stuff, but my current cat just doesn't like the ground variety as well.  He prefers the food with chunks and gobbles it right up.  I've bought tons of this food over the years and many of my cats just loved it.  It just depends on your cat - if you have one that likes ground, give this one a try!\",\n",
       " \"This is my cat's second favorite food.  He's not a senior but he just goes wild over this stuff.  I have to give it to him quite often because he just smells it in the cabinet, I think.  Between this one and the turkey and cheese, I should have been offered stock in the company by now.  There are many, many cases of this stuff that comes home for our cat.  He loves it that much.\",\n",

He doesn't leave this one so he likes it somewhat. It's ground, so that isn't his favorite but you can actually see vegetables in this one. I like that part so that's why I buy it.\",\n",
       " \"This is my cat's third favorite food.  It's great stuff - the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend.

It's just a very nice variety and something I'm sure every cat loves.  My previous cat about ran me down whenever I got it out to give to him and my current cat is no different.

He didn't like it with just the whitefish and I could seldom get him to eat the entire can.  These cans are huge so if you have a cat that loves his fish, then this is a great buy.  Otherwise, stick to the smaller ones for the picky guys.  Mine likes this once a month or so, but that's about it.\",\n",
       " \"This one slipped from my cat's favorite, to being almost out of the picture.  He eats it still, but wants the carved varieties more.  I buy this so much that I think he can smell it through the can when I bring it home.  It's a great food - the pieces are just the right size and not too big for my cat's unusually small mouth.  Friskies makes a great food according to my cat!\",\n",
       " \"Each cat I've had really likes this variety.  They prefer the sliced versions over the ground such as this, but if I buy ground, they only like this one.  It smells pretty normal - not too stinky to make you faint, but it seems more appealing than most cat foods do.  I get pretty positive results with this variety and a lot of purring!\",\n",
       " \"I wish I knew what was really in this variety. It doesn't say much on the can.  I toss this one in for a little variety, but it's not his favorite.  He loves the carved versions the best, but he tolerates this one as one of those I use for a little change of pace for my cat.  He appreciates it some, I think, but seldom eats the entire can.  But I really would like to know what it consists of so I know what he's eating.  The gravy sure looks nice and the pieces are a nice size as well - not too big so he can get it into his small mouth.\",\n",
       " \"I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one.\",\n",
       " \"This version is ground.  NOt my current cat's favorite version, but he really likes the taste. I do wish they'd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too.  My previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean. But, neither wanted it more than once or twice a month.  Why, I don't know but it seems to be a little richer than the others.\",\n",

It's hard to explain except that it didn't melt like other normal goudas I've had in the past.  It's great for slicing up and putting on turkey sandwiches.  Also makes a nice snack when cut into small wedges.  I don't think this would go well in a fondu, unless you used it in combination with another blander type base cheese for your sauce.\",\n",

       " \"I received a very well packaged (and promptly shipped even) package of the Habanero Jerky from Mahogany Smoked Meats.<br /><br /> The jerky itself it obviously made from good meat (vs some of the garbage you'd get from Oberto or whomever). The initial smell is excellent. An aroma of pepper and brown sugar.<br /><br /> However, the Jerky itself is somewhat sticky. The pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together, so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore. After you're done, your hands are all sticky. My guess is if they manufacturer spent a little longer in a dessicator, we'd have a drier product that tasted just as well.<br /><br /> As for how spicy. Well, my lips are burning. I like that. I really love Habanero (and in fact grow several varieties at home). This isn't some &quot;slightly spicy&quot; product with the name Habanero in it to make it seem macho. It will scorch your mouth. In my opinion, scorch in a good way.<br /><br /> The price is great. You'd spend that much at any store, buying a far lower quality of jerky, and just try finding habanero ANYTHING at Safeway.<br /><br /> Kudos to Amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list. Additional kudos to Mahogany Smoked Meats for having such a wonderful product.<br /><br /> I've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky (I guess it's the sugar?), and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves.<br /><br /> Definitely recommended.\",\n",

       " \"Evilspeak (1982), written and directed by Eric Weston, features Ron Howard's lesser known, but more prolific brother Clint Howard (both started out on the classic television series The Andy Griffith Show, as Opie and Leon, respectively).  During the 70's, both brothers starred in a spate of schlocky B movies like Eat My Dust! (1976) and Grand Theft Auto (1977), (most likely due to the fact that they probably had great difficulty in breaking out of the roles they played as children) to name a couple, and while brother Ron used the opportunity to get into directing (he directed the latter of the two films mentioned), his brother Clint seemed content to keep working in front of the cameras, enjoying his status of forever the character actor dwelling on the Hollywood fringe, managing to develop a long, successful career out of it, even making supporting appearances in some of his brothers films (ahhh, sweet nepotism), like Far and Away (1992), Apollo 13 (1995), and Edtv (1999), but his destiny seems to lie in the world of the B movie, and it seems to fit him perfectly.<br /><br />In this film, Clint plays Stanley Coopersmith, a cadet at a military school.  Stanley possesses an above average IQ, is odd looking, an orphan, a loner, and is highly uncoordinated (his fumbling of the ball during the school's soccer matches leads to much angering of the other players along with the coach).  All of these things add up to incessant picking on by a popular clique led by Bubba (played by Don Stark, whom I recognized but couldn't place until I read that he currently appears on the TV show That 70's Show as the goofy neighbor Bob Pinciotti...man, he's really changed, and not for the better).  They harass Stanley constantly, playing all sorts of pranks on him and just making his life miserable.  Stanley is also harassed by others, like his soccer coach, the school's commandant, and even the school's priest, to some degree.  What's a nerd to do?  Well, the answer comes one day while Stanley is cleaning the basement of the school's church as punishment, which happens to have some secret catacombs as the current church sits atop a much older church erected by people cast out of their homeland so many hundreds of years ago and left on the shores of America for their heresy in following religions darker path.  Stanley finds a secret room, which contains many things, including a dark tome, spelling out rituals of evil and instructions on performing black mass.  With the help of an Apple computer borrowed from the school's library, Stanley intends on calling up dark powers to aid him in dealing with his tormentors, but will he get more than he bargained for?  You bet he will...<br /><br />Clint is always fun to watch, and he doesn't disappoint here.  Turning to the dark side to gain supernatural powers to use against my enemies wouldn't have been my first choice, but to each his own.  The story itself is pretty solid, despite various plot holes, and moves along at a steady pace, keeping the viewer's interest throughout until the film's end.  There is a pretty good heaping of gore and nastiness, specifically near the end of the film, along with a couple of scenes with nekkid women (the scene with the secretary taking a shower seemed a bit odd, as she appeared to have a problem with one of her milk glands, as if it was partially deflated somehow, but I digress).  One thing I found interesting was the level of revenge exacted on Stanley's tormentors seemed proportional to the amount of harassment they inflicted on him.  Decapitations, death by possessed pig, removal of vital organs, etc., it's here and more.  Clint is backed up by a rich supporting cast, including veteran film and television actors R.G. Armstrong (Race with the Devil), Joseph Cortese (American History X), Claude Earl Jones (Used Cars), Heywood Nelson (Dwayne from the TV show What's Happening!), and Charles Tyner (The Outlaw Josey Wales).  Probably the element that will put people off most is the exceptionally cheap looking animated graphics supposed to simulate on screen computer graphics, but I found it kind of charming, in its' own cheesy way.  The film's not really scary, but it does get pretty graphic, and those with a weak stomach would probably do well to avoid this film.<br /><br />This release from Anchor Bay Entertainment boasts a restored and uncut version of the film, which means some of the more gory and graphic scenes of bloody carnage removed due to the MPAA's (Motion Picture Association of America) ever changing archaic rules and regulations (this is the group that gave the film Midnight Cowboy, which later won the Oscar for best picture, an unnecessary X rating at the time of its' release) have been put back in...this is one of my favorite aspects about the DVD format, being the opportunity to see movies as they were originally intended to be seen, before they were hacked up in an effort to satisfy some pain in the rear censorship board.  The special features contained on this release include a good-looking wide screen format (some scratches are present), an entertaining audio commentary by writer/producer/director Eric Weston, a production cast member named Warren Lewis, and star Clint Howard, a original theatrical trailer, biographies, a photo gallery, and booklet insert with liner notes.  If I learned anything from this film, it's that it's not unusual for a military academy to keep a stall of pigs on premises.  It certainly serves a purpose as you can have your underachieving cadets clean the pen as a form of punishment, allowing for a less than surefooted victim to slip and fall into all sorts of nastiness...pig guano...ewwwww...overall, this is a three star film with an extra star for the special features.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />PS...look for Richard Moll, Bull on TV's Night Court, as Father Esteban...\",\n",

I\\'ve used the recipe on the back of the bag and adapted it by using a mixture of whole wheat and regular bread flour because I didn\\'t have any \"gluten\" as called for in the recipe.

Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"chicken soup\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"with rice!\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak\\'s catchy 1962 children\\'s book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn\\'t dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak\\'s other great rhyming tale \"Pierre\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It\\'s a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there\\'s robin\\'s nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child\\'s reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you\\'re just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven\\'t found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\" with the correct oomph, you\\'re missing out.<br /><br />I take my \"Chicken Soup With Rice\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin\\' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It\\'s Sendak at his finest.',\n",
       " \"Summary:  A young boy describes the usefulness of chicken soup with rice for each month of the year.<br /><br />Evaluation:  With Sendak's creative repetitious and rhythmic words, children will enjoy and learn to read the story of a boy who loves chicken soup with rice!  Through Sendak's catchy story, children will also learn the months of the year, as well as what seasons go with what month! They learn to identify ice-skating and snowmen in the winter; strong wind in March; birds and flowers in the spring; swimming and hot temperatures in the summer; and finally different holidays throughout the year. Such as Halloween in October, and Christmas in December.<br /><br />Sendak's simple three colored crayon-like drawings are a perfect addition to his educational and entertaining story.<br /><br />A great activity that you can do with this book is to have children draw their own illustrations for each month of the year.  Afterwards you can bind the pages together so the children can create their own book.\",\n",

       " 'For those of you not familiar with the great Urban Legend of the Red Velvet Cake recipe that cost $240 dollars, see Jan Harold Brunvan\\'s series of books on Urban Legends starting with THE VANISHING HITCHIKER available here on Amazon.  Most of us know the legend in it\\'s more modern form as the \"Mrs. Field\\'s Chocolate Chip cookie recipe\" that some poor unsuspecting soul requested and was told would cost \"Two-forty\" and who assumed that meant Two Dollars and forty cents only to receive a credit card bill of $240.  Needless to say the legend is NOT true, never WAS true & never will be true be it about the cookies, Red Velvet Cake or Waldorf Salad( Another part of the legend).<br /><br />Red Velvet Cake started out as a pretty and regional variant of Devil\\'s Food cake and is really just a wonderfully light chocolate cake with red colouring added to it.  It is often topped with either a vanilla buttercream frosting or in more modern times with cream cheese frosting.  The Duncan Hines mix is probably a better option than any of the current recipes floating around that are often remnents of the old Urband Legend for a variety of reasons.  Many of the legendary recipes have bizarre added ingredients intended to make the recipe look weird or authentic and often call for far more food coloring than is needed, imparting a bitter flavor and ghastly colour to the finished cake.<br /><br />Having had the Duncan Hines mix as a child and again more recently, I can attest to its superiority over most of the existing recipes for Red Velvet Cake.  The Duncan Hines Cake Mix has a lovely chocolate flavor and just the right amount of red color to make the final product interesting.  When made as a layer cake (preferabley with four thin layers as opposed to two thick ones) and topped with Cream cheese icing, the Duncan Hines Red Velvet Cake makes a wonderfully festive Holiday cake sure to provoke conversation.  You may find yourself having to give away a number of the boxes of mix you now have to friends eager to make it themselves and share the intriguing legend.  The finished cake truly is a show-stopper!<br /><br />Conventional wisdom is that the cake itself began as a Southern tradition and indeed, it can still be found on the dessert menus of some venerable Southern eateries.  The best I ever had was in Nashville at an old Inn but it wasn\\'t all that superior to the Duncan Hines mix which is more moist and lighter in texture than most Tradtional ( as opposed to \"legendary\" ) recipes.<br /><br />You can still find elaborate versions of Red Velvet cake popping up in places such as the Swiss Colony Holiday Catalog but for outragious prices.  Do what I do and make your own!  Since it is near impossible to find anywhere else, go ahead and order the mix here.  Even if you only make it a few times a year, the mix lasts a long time and is a good value when you consider its \"Star Quality\" as a dessert and a natural conversation piece!  I know of one mom whose daughter got an \\'A\\' when using the cake as a demonstration of modern Folklore in her high-school social studies class!<br /><br />If all that info isn\\'t enough inducement to try it...just remember..it\\'s chocolate cake for heaven\\'s sake!

An added benefit is less mess and ease of clean-up.<br /><br />Unless you live in an area where Southern Cooking ingredients are easily available at the supermarket, you most likely will not find this product on the grocery store shelves.  Ordering it in quantity is not a bad idea since it stores well and when you do finally make it, more than one is usually in order.

       " 'So many black teas (such as pu-erh and yunnan) are so strong and stark, that to find a tea like this (which is assam and ceylon with herbs) is a real treat. First off, make no bones about it, this is a black tea. It has that strong, bitter taste to it that I look forward to from a black tea. However, the aroma is just incredible. Between the cloves and the cinnamon, it\\'s almost as if you\\'ve opened up a box of christmas. The tea itself is very rich and very dark. It produces a little froth on its own, mainly I think because the leaves are so broken up. You\\'ll want a very fine filter, there is sediment through the filter we use.<br /><br />The tea itself has a very strong character of both clove and orange, with cinnamon making the tea very much \"spicy.\" Not spicy enough to detract from the rest of the tea, but certainly enough to get your attention. The box mentions there are 3 kinds of cinnamon in the tea as well. This much I\\'d believe. I know there are at least two kinds -- Sri Lanka and Madagascar -- of cinnamon, it seems reasonable to me that a third might be adding the \"sweet\" flavor that the other reviewer mentioned.<br /><br />It is really just an amazing tea that I think most people will find themselves going through quickly. It\\'s a nice break from the standard black tea fare, if that\\'s what you normally drink.<br /><br />I can compare it to Rishi Tea\\'s \"The Fire\" (another \"spicy\" tea), and the big difference here is the body. Rishi\\'s offering has a very light boody, whereas this tea almost tastes like it\\'s had molasses added. Yum. All the spice, and character to boot.<br /><br />Highly recommended.',\n",
       " \"Anyone who has ever visited New Orleans will most likely have a tale to tell of a late-night or early morning visit to the world-famous Cafe Du Monde (cafe of the world) for a snack of Beignets and Chicory coffee.<br /><br />This simple little square fritter with powdered sugar is often imitated but somehow never quite the same as the cafe Du Monde version.  The authetic mix guarantees you that Cafe Du Monde taste and they are relatively easy to fry up at home for a weekend morning treat.  Traditonally fried in Cottonseed oil, most home-cooks opt for a healthier, lighter oil but anyway you fry them, these are not exactly health food!<br /><br />Essentially, Beignets are fried dough covered with generous amounts of powedered sugar.  Traditionally served by themselves on a plate a of three with cups of Chicory coffee, you can, if you want, get adventurous and fill them with fruit (cherry works best) compote or sweet cream cheese for variety. You can also set a few sugared blueberries and a sprig of mint in the middle of a plate of three beignets for a classic presentation. They are so scrumptious that you needen't really offer anything else but some folks like to include Beignets as part of a larger brunch menu.  Me, I prefer just the Beignets with their traditional beverage, for a mid-morning light brunch.  These are best if fried up in large batches for a group since frying anything in small amounts seems like too much effort for too little outcome, but one box at a time is okay too.<br /><br />While there are plenty of beignet recipes out there, this mix is super-easy and carries the Cafe Du Monde name. They turn out well and taste very much like the real thing.  It is worth the effort to make sure you also serve up some Chicory Coffee as well since it is the pairing of the two that evokes the strong memory of nights in New Orleans.  The strong taste of the Chicory compliments the simplicity of the beignets beautifully.\",\n",

       " 'This tiny jar of concentrated yeast extract is quite the breakfast food. To use Marmite, spread it thinly on toast or sandwich bread. Wait! What do you mean by \"thinly?\" I mean, practically thin enough to be  a monolayer of molecules, because if you spread it any thicker, it will taste pretty strong. Well, actually, I use a quarter of a teaspoon on each piece of toast, which is buttered first to lubricate the process. And wait, how would one spread it thinly on fresh, untoasted AMERICAN bread without it tearing the fluffy crumb into tiny balls only suitable for feeding the koi? Again, a bit of softened butter, then a schmear of Marmite, a slice of tomato and you have a super tea sandwich. This is often my dinner, when I want something light.<br /><br />How and why was Marmite invented, and how did it become a beloved British traditional food, right up there with hedgehog-flavoured potato crisps? Back in 1902, some genius took the lees of good old British Ale, that is to say, Brewer\\'s Yeast, and boiled it down to a tarry, black substance that no one in their right mind would eat unless their Mum forced them to. Because of the B-complex, Marmite became popular as a supplement for prisoners-of-war, served in hospitals, schools, to troops in WWI and WWII. It almost was rationed in WWII, with mothers told to spread it \"very thinly, for now.\"<br /><br />Traditionally, Marmite is served on sandwiches and especially on toast at breakfast on toast \"soldiers\" or triangles of toast that kids can dip into their boiled eggs. The flavor is meaty, salty, though it has less salt than the butter you might use with it, and it has no meat or animal product--it\\'s made of yeast so is vegetarian-vegan.<br /><br />The flavor, frankly, takes some getting used to if you don\\'t like strong, savory things. However, if you like savory, meaty flavors and want something non-sugary sweet on  your breakfast toast, Marmite is fantastic. The closest I can describe the flavor is on the order of soy sauce, beef bouillion or mushroom pate. Other uses for Marmite are to flavor soups, meat or vegetable loaves, and stews, as a mix in dips or on bread for sandwiches and canapes.<br /><br />4 grams or about 1/8 ounce of Marmite has the following B vitamins:<br /><br />Riboflavin  0.28mg (17.5% RDA)<br />Niacin  5.4mg (35.6% RDA)<br />Folic Acid  100ug (50.0% RDA)<br />Vitamin B12  0.5ug (60.0% RDA)',\n",

The only nationally available cream soda I can recommend over this one is the more complex Henry Weinhard Vanilla Cream, but truly each has their merits.<br /><br />Boylan's attractive clear-glass bottles compliment the fabulous caramel colour and the beverage is Kosher, so these make a fine addition to any social gathering.

I'm not a huge fan of Starbucks, I find their coffee too bitter, but like everyone else I truck over there spending close to $4.00 a cup on a specialty latte. This is different. This is like the coffee I had every morning in Provence. It has great flavor and the frothy top is something you could never get with your regular coffee maker. I love that I can do one cup at a time, so my coffee isn't sitting on the warming plate losing its flavor until I'm ready for another cup. It froths itself, so you don't have to deal with complicated and hard to clean steaming mechanisms. It takes a minute to boil the water and then less than 30 seconds to fill the cup, which is much quicker than making regular coffee. It is easy to put together, take apart and clean; in fact, when I was comparing the similar-looking Mr. Coffee and Black and Decker brands in the store I couldn't get those two models back together after I looked at the pod holder, which cinched the decision for me on the Senseo (which has a very simple press-down locking mechanism). I'm so glad!!! I haven't tried the dark roast yet, but we love the medium and the decaf, and the mild is nice for afternoon. I was worried about the cost of the pods until I realized that a bag of 18 is under $4.00, which is like 22 cents a pod.

Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk.

       " 'The history of soft drinks goes all the way back to the mineral water found in natural springs.  The first marketed (non-carbonated) soft drinks, made from water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, appeared in the 17th century. The first drinkable manmade glass of carbonated water was created by an Englishmen, Dr. Joseph Priestley, nine years before the Declaration of Independence.  In 1832, John Mathews invented an apparatus for making carbonated water.  The drinking of natural (or even artificial) mineral water was considered a healthy practice so American pharmacists were adding medicinal and other flavorful herbs (birch bark, sarsaparilla, fruit extracts) to unflavored beverage from their soda fountains.  Then their customers wanted to start taking the drinks home with them and thus the soft drink bottling industry was born, leading eventually to \"Rock and Roller Cola Wars.\"<br /><br />In 1893 in New Bern, North Carolina, a young pharmacist named Caleb Bradham began experimenting with a wide variety of different soft drink concoctions that friends and patrons could try out at his drugstore soda fountain.  Five year\\'s later the most popular formulation, known as \"Brad\\'s Drink,\" a combination of carbonated water, sugar, vanilla, rare oils and cola nuts, is named Pepsi-Cola and in 1902 the company was incorporated.  The product was sold with the slogan: \"Exhilarating, Invigorating, Aids Digestion.\"  By 1995 the company\\'s slogan was \"Nothing else is a Pepsi.\"  PepsiCo.\\'s restaurant division, Tircon Global Restaurants, Inc., which includes Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, & KFC, is the largest restaurant company in the world in terms of units and second-largest in sales (go ahead and guess who is bigger and what cola they happen to sell).<br /><br />Here we have 144 fluid ounces of Pepsi Cola divided into a dozen 12 ounce cans as the \"6-Pack\" goes the way of the nickle bottle of Pepsi.  Today, Pepsi is a concoction of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid and natural flavors.  The high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar part has me puzzled, simply because I would think that once a corporation has a major formula they do not mess with it in any way shape or form.  So now I am wondering if the taste difference between high fructose corn syrup based Pepsi Cola and sugar based Pepsi Cola is as significant as the difference between soda fountain Pepsi Cola and Pepsi Cola in a can (the latter is better).  In addition to the 150 calories per 12 fluid ounce serving you get the following percentage daily values (based on a 2,000 calorie diet):<br /><br />Total Fat (0g) 0%<br />Sodium (35 mg) 1%<br />Potassium (10 mg)<br />Total Carbohydrates (41 g of Sugars)  14%<br />Protein (0 g) 0%<br /><br />There is also 25 mg of caffeine, a fact that is not included in the Nutrition Facts on the side of the can, which I find interesting because I know I am not alone in drinking Pepsi for the caffeine instead of the sodium or sugars.  But I also know that I like the sweeter more refreshing taste of Pepsi as compared to the competition (Bill Cosby once dismissed the idea that we wanted cola with a \"sweeter\" taste, but he was wrong).<br /><br />When I was in England several years ago I saw a whole bunch of ad posters in which things that were traditionally red over there, such as mailboxes and phone booths, were suddenly blue.  Of course I now know this was in anticipation of Pepsi going from white cans to blue cans.  You might wonder how much money was spent to determine that blue versus red was a better marketing position than white versus red, but when you are going up against a product whose brand name has become the generic name for cola, you need to look for every marketing opportunity.<br /><br />For most of us the history of Pepsi is found not in the can (or the bottle), but the advertising slogans.  See how far back in history you can go down this trip along memory lane: \"Be Young. Have Fun. Drink Pepsi\" (1993), \"Choice of a New Generation\" (1992), \"You Got The Right One Baby\" (1990), \"The choice of a New Generation\" (1984), \"Have a Pepsi Day!\" (1976), \"Pepsi Generation\" (1962), \"Now it\\'s Pepsi, for those who think young\" (1960), \"The Light Refreshment\" (1953), \"Bigger Drink, Better Taste\" (1943), \"Drink Pepsi-Cola, it will satisfy you\" (1920), and \"The Original Food Drink\" (1906).',\n",

       " 'Unquestionably the most refined of teas, Darjeeling comes from a region in the Indian (West Bengalese) Himalayas close to the Nepalese border, 7000 ft above sea level. Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area\\'s natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called \"Darjeeling,\" tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region.<br /><br />Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or \"flushes\": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.)

       " \"This review is written for Pill Pockets for Cats (Amazon ASIN:B00061MVTG). Amazon will sometimes post this review next to Greenies Pill Pockets. Unless Greenies bought Pill Pockets for Cats and has reissued it under their label, this is a mistake. I've NEVER TRIED GREENIES. I took my original 2004 review down and am reposting it with this warning.<br /><br />Pill Pockets for Cats are soft, hollow, little cat treats. They are shaped like a cup. The concept is simple. Put the pill in the opening and then seal it by pinching it closed, then feed it to your cat. Our cat was a little hesitant the first couple times, so we would put a little catfood gravy on it (which she adores). She ate it right up. Sometimes she would get fussy and not eat it (mainly because she's an annoying, spoiled little critter), but I've found that dressing it up with dried bonito flakes works really well too. Now she looks forward to her daily treat and would remind me if she didn't get it.<br /><br />The pockets in the first bag were similar to the consistency of Velveeta, though the second bag was a little more dried out and tended to crumble. Our cat prefers the pill pockets when they are moist, but she will still eat the drier ones. I think that the product dries out as it sits on the shelf. If you are buying the product from a store (as opposed to Amazon), shake the bag. If it rattles a lot like the pieces are loose, the product is more likely to be dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Unless you have a lot of cats, I don't recommend buying the product in large quantities. After the bag is opened, the product tends to start drying out. For us, the 45-count bag was just right, by the time we got to the bottom, the pills were drier, but still moist enough for my cat to eat them without too much coaxing.<br /><br />Our veterinarian prescribed tiny tablets for our cat (cut in half), so there is plenty of room to spare. I would guess that you could probably fit a pill the size of an aspirin in there, but you might have to stretch it a bit.<br /><br />The Pill Pockets are a bit pricey (around $7 for 45 pieces), but it's so much easier than stuffing a pill down the cat's throat, that it's really worth it.<br /><br />Pill Pockets for Cats (salmon flavor) comes in a metallic pinkish bag. The chicken flavor comes in a yellowish bag, but we've never tried it.. Pill Pockets for Cats used to come in clear plastic bags, but I think they found that opaque bags keeps the product fresh longer. Greenies comes in a green bag.\",\n",

       " 'It was in the 1920s that the H.B. Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey\\'s milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese\\'s Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese\\'s started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese\\'s bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this pair of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them. Fortunately this is a 2 cup packages, because my way of eating Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups is to eat them all. Open up a wrapper with four cups, I eat four. Open up a wrapper with two cups, I eat two. You do not want to enjoy too much of a good thing when it comes to candy.',\n",

       " \"It absolutely amazes me that some people spend over two dollars for a single cup of coffee, yet still buy those low cost tea bags from the grocery store, and then claim to like coffee better.  Many people have not tasted a real good cup of tea.  Good tea does not come in a 200 count per cardboard box - the tea should have higher quality and shouldn't be in a cheap cardboard box at all.  It should be in a sealed tin or packed in an airtight bag in order to preserve the flavor, and the leaves should be specially selected.  The cheapest teas are bought in bulk from the lowest quality teas parts of the tea leaf.  Yes, cost does matter in tea, just like coffee.<br /><br />Unless you're really lazy (which, I admit, I am), teas should also never, ever, be served from a bag.  Teas should be in loose form, not confined in a bag.  Why?  Because tea leaves need to expand in the water to release their full flavor.  You can buy loose tea leaves buy on amazon, high end grocery store, or in specially markets (e.g. Cost Plus), or tea shoppes.<br /><br />Now, unless you want to brew a whole pot with tea leaves in the plot, there are not many ways to make tea right for just one person.  This mug solve the single serving dilemma.  It's big, sturdy, and made of glass.  The most important thing though is that it comes with an infuser.  It looks like a cylindrical filter that is placed into the mug.  Just spoon a bit of the tea into the filter, dunk in the mug, and the tea will be brewed right then and there.  The result is some of the best tea you'll have ever drank.  The brewing is really easy, add tea to the filter, and add sub boiling hot water, wait, remove the infuser, and drink.  If you need to add sugar or cream, well, that's your choice, but I believe the right tea needs none of that.<br /><br />To make tea, place one to two spoonfuls in the filter, then pour in 160 degree water for green, steeped for a little less than 2 minutes, 180 degrees for white tea, steeped for over 5 minutes, and about 200 degrees for black or oolong, steeped for about three to four minutes.  No - you don't have to measure the temperature each time, only when first starting out.  Just bring the water to boiling, then let it cool down  until the desired temperature is reached.  Count those seconds.  Next time you make tea, boil, wait for those amount of seconds and then pour in the mug.  Easy.<br /><br />I suggest trying different teas (without adding anything), until you find your right one.  My personal favorite is Green Well Green Tea, but I still have a lot to try.<br /><br />Tea is like wine, cheese, coffee, or beer.  Quality and tastes vary tremendously, and if you only try the cheap stuff, you'll never really enjoy it like you should.\",\n",

The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe\\'s original ingredient). Using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea\\'s natural flavor - but with Twinings you just can\\'t go wrong, because the original Earl Grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his Chinese friend.<br /><br />(From the Twinings website: \"When the mandarin\\'s tasty gift began to run out, Earl Grey asked his tea merchants, Twinings, to match it for him. Twinings unique blend was the Grey family\\'s long-standing favourite. When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey\\'s tea by name.\")<br /><br />Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend\\'s particular flavor. (But that\\'s just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley.',\n",
       " 'Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the \"green pearl\" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area\\'s gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea\\'s elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.',\n",
       " 'Introduced to Kenya from India in 1903 by a settler named G.W.L.Caine, nowadays tea is one of Kenya\\'s major economic sectors; directly or indirectly employing roughly 10% of the country\\'s population and, at over over 180,000 tonnes per year, constituting around 10% of total global tea production or 20% of worldwide export. Kenyan tea is grown at elevations between 5,000 and 7,000 feet and generally harvested year-round. The primary growth regions are the Nandi Hills and the highlands around Kericho north of the Massai Mara Game Reserve and west of the central Kenyan Great Rift Valley, which in turn is the home of Meru National Park (of George and Joy Adamson/\"Born Free\" fame - further east near Mount Kenya) and Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen\\'s beloved Ngong Hills (in the south near Nairobi).<br /><br />Kenyan tea has small, grainy leaves and a rich color and distinct, full-bodied aroma that makes it a near ideal breakfast tea and as such, a nice alternative to the traditional English breakfast blend (which sometimes contains Kenyan teas as well).',\n",

       " 'Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word \"mati\" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served.  On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea.  Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant\\'s ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion\\'s powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman\\'s faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land.  In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well.  In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts.',\n",

       " 'It was in the 1920s that the H.B. Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey\\'s milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese\\'s Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese\\'s started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese\\'s bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this 6 pack of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them without resorting to making them.',\n",

       " 'I had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the Pet Expo in Del Mar, CA and had noticed how wonderful it smells. The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.<br /><br />I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any \"dust\" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.<br /><br />As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily \"stirring\", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.<br /><br />The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don\\'t dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says \"CHEMICAL FREE...\" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read \"HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE\" or \"BIOTOXIN FREE\".<br /><br />Anyway, I\\'ll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport.

It\\'s a great tea for any time of the day and with any accompaniment, on its own, or with sugar or cream.<br /><br />Twinings employs the carbon dioxide method of decaffeination for their decaf teas. The tea is exposed to compressed carbon dioxide, which acts as a solvent, extracting the caffeine while leaving larger molecules unaffected. The process preserves more flavor and removes more caffeine than water process decaffeination. 97% of caffeine must be eliminated for a beverage to be called \"decaffeinated\", which would leave only a few milligrams of caffeine per cup of tea, regardless of the method.<br /><br />For a departure from plain tea, these are my favorite recipes:<br /><br />*Homemade Mint Tea*<br />This is wonderful consumed hot and incomparable served over ice in the summer: Bring about 3 quarts of water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/4 cup of sugar, and a handful of sliced fresh mint leaves to a boil in a saucepan.

       " 'This coffee is great!  The Senseo machine can be difficult to use as far as getting pods into it correctly.  I am not sure what has happened to the people reporting \"steam locks\" but I have had issues when:<br /><br />  - the pod is not inserted properly<br /><br />  - the pod holder is not seated correctly within the machine<br /><br />  - the pod is not prepared for insertion properly<br /><br />My issues were varied, but basically consisted of hot water  coming out of the sides of the coffee maker and no coffee would be brewed, and the pod would have to be discarded.  This happened to me with Senseo pods, and probably would have happened with the Aloha Island pods except that I learned how to deal with the machine.<br /><br />Also in some of these cases the lid to the coffee maker would be stuck, (possibly the dreaded \"steam lock\"), but I was always able to open the machine after a minute or so of wiggling the lock/release handle on the machine, which I would think most people would do automatically when the machine doesn\\'t open.<br /><br />By properly preparing the pod for insertion I am able to use single pods for the Melitta One in my Senseo as well as the Aloha Island pods and of course the Senseo pods.  If you don\\'t put it in just right, you will have problems.  The key is to spread the coffee equally around within the Pod before inserting it into the machine.  Do this by wiggling the pod around a bit (take about 5 seconds).  The helpful instructions with the Aloha Island pods say to \"break up the coffee\" within the pod before using, which has the same effect.  It took me five months to figure this out while using the Senseo pods, especially when brewing two cups.  I wish Senseo would have included a little note like Aloha Island did.<br /><br />During shipping the coffee can settle or collect within the pod, either on a side(s) or even in the middle.  This changes the thickness of the pod, ever so slightly, and the machines tolerance for different thickness pods appears to be extremely low!<br /><br />So smooth out your pods and enjoy, I think that any problems you have with pods are really problems with the design of the machine, not the pods themselves.',\n",

       " 'In 1923 the Milky Way bar was created with the idea of putting \"A chocolate malted milk in a candy bar\".  The original Milky Way bar was created in both chocolate and vanilla flavors, even though the latter had a dark bittersweet chocolate coating.  The name was trademarked in 1925 and sold nationally the following year for 5 cents.  In 1932 the 5-cent bar was increased to a two-piece bar and then in 1936 it went back to being a one-piece bar and the vanilla Milky Way bar was changed to the Forever Yours bar.  If you were wondering why you do not remember the Forever Yours bar that was because it was discontinued in 1979, so I would strongly advise against eating any Forever Yours bars that you might happen to find.  However, in 1989 they came out with the Milky Way Dark bar, which basically had the same ingredients as the Forever Yours bar, but you should not eat any of those either because in 2000 the Milky Way Dark Bar was renamed the Milky Way Midnight bar, because the name change along was seen as a way of increasing sales, so those you can safely eat.  Outside of the United States if you want a Milky Way bar then you just gets a Mars bar.<br /><br />A Milky Way bar is made of chocolate malt-flavored nougat and caramel covered with milk chocolate.  The nougat part is made by whipping egg whites with other ingredients until light and frothy enough to make a frappe.  That is when the cocoa and malt flavorings are added to the frappe to create the candy bar\\'s signature flavor.  As for the wiggly lines on the bottom of the bars, those come from the belt they ride on while cooling.  In 1999, in case you did not notice it, the Milky Way brand was reformulated and relaunched.  The year before they made over 200 million single size Milky Way bars produced in the United States, so they decided to change everything, from the packaging, slogan, and advertising (\"Milk it!\") to the taste.  The Milky Way bar saw a 20% increase in the caramel and the chocolate was made chunkier (however the Milky Way Dark bar that is now the Milky Way Midnight bar had its caramel increased by only 10%).  Today the slogan for Milky Way is \"Pleasure you can\\'t measure.\"<br /><br />The ingredients in a Milky Way bar are milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk, chocolate, lactose, milk fat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor), corn syrup, sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, skim milk, less than 2% milk fat, cocoa powder processed with alkali, lactose, malted barley, wheat flour, salt, egg whites, artificial flavor.  Each Milky Way bar is 2.05 oz (58.12 g) and has 270 calories, of which 90 are calories from fat (which is not as bad as it sounds).  The product is gluten free but is only kosher certified in the Celebrations package.  The key thing here is the taste, which combines milk chocolate with creamy caramel and fluffy nougat into a pretty sweet tasting candy bar.',\n",

       " \"I really do like my Senseo coffee maker.  I, like others who have reviewed the Kona Pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. I was excited to see that Kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'.  I have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews here, I could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable.  It just didn't make sense.  Well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee I made using the Kona pods also.<br /><br />My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally. The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod I have ever used in my Senseo.  The instructions for the Kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine.  The Kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package.  I always  wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the Senseo. After my problems with the Kona pods, my husband decided that I was not 'wiggling' them enough.  He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open.  So, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods.  That did not make much sense, but after several cups of Kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods.  The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water.  There is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done.  The pod itself is heavier when I take it out to throw it away.  So, I believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.<br /><br />Then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the Kona pods.  The problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle. The 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water!  This problem is one that I still cannot really figure out.  The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods I have tried.  So, I guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee.  I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate.  I have tried wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod.  But, that has not worked for me.<br /><br />So, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me.  I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get using other brands.  So, adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work.<br /><br />I have been reading of a product called an EcoPod.  It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers.  It might be the next thing I try.\",\n",

And the Folger's is a dollar cheaper (at least, at Bed Bath and Beyond).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not above paying more if the coffee's better.  I don't really care that much.

Its lower grade, Yunnan Jig, is quite good and very inexpensive, but Yunnan gold is fantastic.  It is an assertive tea, able to stand up nicely to milk and sugar, but it isn't the slightest bit bitter.  I have had it black and it was still tasty, but I prefer to have black teas light and sweet.  Even when I have accidentally over-steeped it (you should steep it for about 3 minutes), it was smooth and mellow.  There is a natural sweetness to this tea and very complex flavors that are spicy yet subtle.<br /><br />FYI, this is considered a black tea.  Black teas are so named, based upon how long they are allowed to ferment.  Green tea has the least fermentation, oolong has some fermentation, and black teas are allowed to reach complete fermentation.  Generally speaking the more a tea is fermented the more caffiene it contains.<br /><br />This is a perfect all day tea.  A pleasure first thing in the morning, and yet delightful all day and into the night (it has caffiene so if you have insomnia avoid drinking it and all caffiene beverages after 4 PM).

That aroma is created during the tea\\'s smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.<br /><br />Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long.

       " 'Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the \"green pearl\" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area\\'s gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea\\'s elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.',\n",
       " 'Yunnan province on the mighty Mekong river in southwestern China (north of Vietnam and Laos) gained its name, which means \"South of the Clouds,\" during the Tang dynasty (AD 618 - 907), when a local prince, having made the tedious journey to the Emperor\\'s court, told his sovereign that he had come from the lands south of the rainy weather in Sichuan. The mountain-encased and until recently not easily accessible province is probably the location of the mythical Shangri-La, referred to in James Milton\\'s \"Lost Horizons,\" as well as home to the ancient city of Lijang (a UNESCO world heritage site) in the shadow of the mighty Yulong (Jade Dragon) Snow Mountain, Bai horses, Dali marble and numerous medicinal products, including one of China\\'s famous \"wonder drugs,\" the white powder known as \"Baibao Dan\" (One Hundred Treasures Drug), which is said to cure everything from injuries to certain gynecological diseases, and frequently applied to clean open wounds and stop bleeding, stimulate blood circulation, and against inflammations.<br /><br />Tea plantation in Yunnan began about 1700 years ago, during the Sung Dynasty (AD 960 - 1279), when the city of Pu\\'erh in the South of the province became a major tea trading center; although at least in Yunnan\\'s northwestern corner the tradition is probably even older and was imported across the border from Tibet during the Tang dynasty. Elsewhere, bricks of Pu-erh tea also constituted the first medium of monetary exchange used by nomads beyond the Great Wall of China, and their use has been recorded as early as A.D. 476.<br /><br />Yunnan is a broadleaf tea with a distinctly bright color and intense, lasting, slightly peppery or spicy taste.

Its about an out of shape, nerdy, military school cadet who gets picked on mercilessly.  With the help of a cheesy old Apple computer and an ancient demonic tome, he exacts gruesome, bloody revenge on his tormentors.  Wow, this film should be the bible for all nerds who have ever been bullied.  I, myself, was brutally harrassed in school during the early 80's and would have loved to have seen this movie for inspiration.  Unfortunately, it was never available in the video stores near me.  What a treat for it to be finally out on DVD, restored and uncut, with commentary by the great Mr. CLINT HOWARD!!!  Clint Howard is a brilliant and talented actor who is sadly underrated.  His scenes of vengeance are perfect.  I mean twisted spinal columns, flesh-eating pigs, projectiles to the head, decapitations, disembowlings and nekkid women!!  This is the perfect movie for dorks like me to cuddle up to on a Friday night, with an endless supply of soda and snacks.  So for all you hopeless nerds like me, get this DVD, call all your comic book and action figure collecting friends and spend an unlonely weekend for once watching this movie and discussing it over popcorn, potato chips, beef jerky, ice cream and pizza.  By the way, Clint Howard mentions in the commentary that he would be interested in making a sequel to EvilSpeak.  We should write the studios and demand that a sequel be made.

       " 'All successful actors have a role or a film that defines them for the rest of their careers. Tom Cruise has \"Risky Business.\" Robert De Niro has \"Taxi Driver.\" Marlon Brando had a lot of them, including \"On the Waterfront,\" \"The Godfather,\" and \"Apocalypse Now.\" Who can watch Jimmy Stewart and not think of \"It\\'s a Wonderful Life\"? See what I mean? The list could on and on indefinitely. The lesser known actors, while not as visible to the majority of moviegoers, are critical to the success of Hollywood because they often take supporting roles that make the leads look good. They are recognizable faces to niche film fans, however. Enter Clint Howard, brother of the better known director and actor Ron Howard. Horror movie fans will forever pay homage to Clint--he of the perpetually balding pate, goofy visage, and lumbering gait--for his seminal role of Stanley Coopersmith in the 1982 gorefest \"Evilspeak.\" They will just as likely hold a grudge against him for appearing in Uwe Boll\\'s atrocious \"House of the Dead,\" but that\\'s another story for another time. Clint has appeared in dozens of films, as well as most of the films lensed by his brother, but \"Evilspeak\" is his defining moment.<br /><br />\"Evilspeak\" opens in the distant past by showing a group of Spaniards excommunicating Esteban (Richard Moll) and his followers from the Church for blasphemous activities. What sorts of activities? The movie doesn\\'t spend much time explaining what these folks are doing, but we do see Esteban performing some sort of bizarre ritual on the beach immediately before sacrificing a young lady to his dark deities. Flash forward to the present--meaning 1981 or 1982--to a soccer game at the West Andover Military Academy. Stanley Coopersmith (Howard) trips at a critical moment and loses the game for the team. The abuse heaped upon this poor lad is extreme. Coach (Claude Earl Jones) initially sticks up for Coopersmith by telling his teammates that every boy at the academy gets a shot at playing for the school. Within seconds of this exclamation, the coach helpfully makes a \"suggestion\" to Bubba (Don Stark) and his pals that if an injury sidelined Stanley, there wouldn\\'t be much anyone could do about it. Wow, what a bunch of jerks! This is only the beginning, however, as we soon learn that the entire school seems to have it in for this poor kid. Colonel Kincaid (Charles Tyner), the commandant of the academy, can\\'t stand him either. Neither can Reverend Jameson (Joseph Cortese) or the alcoholic caretaker Sarge (R.G. Armstrong).<br /><br />Things start to look up for Coopersmith when he discovers a labyrinth of corridors underneath the school. Wouldn\\'t you just know it? It turns out that the academy sits on the very site where Esteban and his followers established a church devoted to Satan. Stanley\\'s discovery is in actuality Esteban\\'s old haunt. Our hero finds a book written in Latin containing many conjurations and dark prayers, and it isn\\'t too long before he\\'s entering all of this stuff into his computer in an effort to discover what it means. Meanwhile, the torment continues. Bubba and his fellow goons destroy Stanley\\'s class project, and physically assault him in the corridors every chance they get. Kincaid administers a whipping, and Jameson can barely look at the boy without cringing. Coopersmith\\'s dark discoveries soon take on a vengeful tone as he begins actively collecting the necessary materials to cast a spell against his tormenters. The final straw occurs when Bubba and his friends perform an act so despicable against the only thing Coopersmith cares about in the entire world. From this point forward the gloves are off as \"Evilspeak\" turns into an unmitigated gorefest of epic proportions. Note to self: never pick on anyone again. EVER.<br /><br />\"Evilspeak\" never lets us forget that Clint Howard is the star of the film. The camera rarely leaves him, which is a good thing because we see what a fine actor he is. Howard gives his put upon character great depth, makes us believe totally that he\\'s a rather inept kid with a penchant for clumsiness yet deep inside is a good guy just looking to improve his lot in life. Stanley Coopersmith is so harassed that you can\\'t help but root for him. Perhaps I should compliment the other actors at this point as well because they come across as the most unlikable bunch of cretins in B movie history, and that is exactly what the script called for them to do. I cheered at the end as Coopersmith took gory revenge against his oppressors. Speaking of the gore, \"Evilspeak\" contains several scenes of carnage and general mayhem rarely witnessed in American horror films. The pigs paying a visit to the secretary at her home should win some sort of award, but the real gooey stuff appears at the end. Imagine an airborne Clint Howard in devilish makeup slicing through heads and limbs with an enormous sword. Yep, it\\'s gory, it\\'s gluey, and it\\'s great.<br /><br />A huge thanks goes out to Anchor Bay for releasing such a fine DVD version of the film. Extras include a commentary with Howard and director Eric Weston, poster stills, and a trailer. The commentary is a lot of fun due to Clint Howard\\'s observations. He tells lots of great stories, including one about some problems he encountered with law enforcement when he wore his military uniform from the film to a Las Vegas casino several years later. Clint seems like a great guy and his enthusiasm for the film appears genuine. Weston and Howard even discuss the idea of making a sequel!

       " 'Some of us should be warned about two important facts about this Annie\\'s product:<br /><br />1. It is made from organic, white cheddar cheese.<br /><br />2. These are shells, not macaroni.<br /><br />Point number one is very important. Not just because the cheese is organic (organic pastuerized milk, salt, enzymes), although that is very important to some people. No, it is mentioned here because some purists will eat only YELLOW cheddar cheese. White cheddar cheese makes white cheddar cheese sauce, and together they make something to eat with the color of white cheddar cheese. Therefore, this will look white--not snow white--but a soft creamy white, and some people (who will not be mentioned here) insist on yellow. Often this is a bright, unrealistic looking yellow, almost like it\\'s radioactive, but I am not one to judge.<br /><br />The second thing to know is that the noodle-like things covered with the white cheddar cheese sauce are NOT macaroni. (As in \"stuck a feather in his hat and called it...\") These are \"shells.\" They resemble some sea shells, like the kind that Pagoo the hermit climbed into in that book, or like the rounded shells--only smaller--that you can put up to your ear and supposedly you can then hear almost anything, like even something happening in New York or France. Again, these are not macaroni, and this is important because there are some people who will eat only the little tubes known as macaroni.<br /><br />If you are OK with this, then you\\'re in luck, and you don\\'t need to look any further for a good lunch, dinner, or after play snack (or school, if you go to school).

It was a delicious flavorful alternative to equally delicious homemade hot cocoa for special occasions. I have never been satisfied with easy or \"instant\" methods of making plain hot cocoa. They just can\\'t compete with the richness of heavy cream and melted chocolate. But my Mocha Caf&eacute; au Lait met its match in Ghirardelli\\'s Chocolate Mocha. This is a wonderful powdered mix of chocolate, vanilla, and coffee.<br /><br />The instructions tell you to mix 3 tablespoons of Ghirardelli\\'s Chocolate Mocha with 8 oz (1 cup) of milk, heat, and serve. I find that 2 tablespoons with 2/3 cup of milk fills the average cup or mug. And I always use half-and-half instead of milk. Topped with sweetened whipped cream, this makes a decadent, filling dessert that rivals homemade and restaurant beverages and is attractive enough to serve to guests. Serve with a spoon for those who like to eat the whipped cream before it all melts into the chocolate.<br /><br />Ghirardelli provides microwave and stovetop directions. The microwave instructions advise heating the milk for 1-1 1/2 minutes before adding the Chocolate Mocha mix. I don\\'t think the 2-step process is necessary, but if you\\'ve ever tried to heat milk or half-and-half in a microwave, you know how quickly it can get out of hand. One second nothing is happening; the next second the milk has bubbled all over the floor of your oven, leaving little in the cup. If you want to heat the hot chocolate in the microwave, you can add the Chocolate Mocha mix before you heat the milk, but don\\'t take your eyes off of it once you start heating. If you see any bubbles, stop the microwave immediately, stir the drink, and heat more as necessary. Keep doing that until it\\'s hot enough for you.',\n",

       " 'There are two soft drink giants in North America, and I assume they are the two biggest world-wide, the Coca Cola Company and the Pepsi-Cola Company.  The battle between these two giants has many fields, including fountain drinks, schools, and grocery stores.  At various times the two players have held varying percentages of the market, with Coke currently being ascendant.<br /><br />We drank Coke in our house from the time I can remember.  There were numerous brands of soft drinks and colas to which I have been exposed, but I have always returned to the original, Coca Cola.<br /><br />Coca Cola is more than a soft drink; it is frequently synonymous with America and freedom in many parts of the world.  In fact, you can say that Coca Cola has become an American icon, though it is available world wide.  Coca Cola memorabilia has become popular as collectibles, with various items dating back to the first half of the last century going for incredible sums of money.<br /><br />At the core of the company name, the memorabilia and the attributes associated with the name is the product itself, the one and only Coca Cola.  The product itself started life as a tonic in 1886, growing steadily in popularity and distribution so that it is probably the American brand with the greatest world-wide recognition.<br /><br />The original Coke contained sugar and remains a yummy soft drink.  However, for those of us who like the flavor of Coke but do not need the calories, Diet Coke is my preferred alternative.  I remember when I first started drinking Diet Coke that I had a little bit of difficulty becoming accustomed to the flavor, but now that I have become accustomed to the flavor of Diet Coke I find the flavor of classic Coke to be a little strange.  I drink far more Diet Coke than classic Coke.<br /><br />I think I prefer Diet Coke over Diet Pepsi because Diet Coke has a slightly stronger emphasis on carbonation.  The mild burn as the cold carbonation goes down your throat is somehow enervating and refreshing, and reminds me of good times and good things.  All my associations with Diet Coke are positive.<br /><br />The 12 can Fridge Pack is a one of the numerous ways in which Diet Coke can be purchased.  The biggest advantage to the Fridge Pack is that it is specifically intended to sit on a refrigerator shelf and be a dispensing unit for cans of Diet Coke.  The only problem with the Fridge Pack is that you must remove one can of Diet Coke when you open the box, so you either have to sit the single can on the shelf or you have to drink it, if you plan on using the box as a dispenser.<br /><br />I still prefer 12 ounce cans over the various other size configurations because I can usually drink an entire can, thus preserving the carbonation and fresh flavor of the drink.  The two liter bottles are fine if you are having a party or drink a lot of Diet Coke, but it seems to me that as the bottle gets near the bottom the Diet Coke seems less fresh if the bottle has been around more than a day or two; the same with the 20 ounce bottles, which I am unable to drink in one sitting.<br /><br />Diet Coke is a personal favorite, even over the original Classic Coke.  I occasionally will drink another brand for variety or other reasons, but I always come back to the original.  As Coke once advertised, \"Have a Coke and a smile!\"',\n",
       " \"This is my favorite taco sauce. Just tastes the way taco sauce seems it should. I'm not a big fan of chunky sauces and this is nice and smooth. Has the right amount of seasonings. Hot, but not too hot, just a little kick. I use it on tacos, quesadillas, to dip chicken in, fajitas.\",\n",
       " \"Can you believe that there are people out there who can't tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke?  And if they can, some people can't put the tang/taste to the label?  Strange.<br /><br />Long story short, I didn't drink too much soda while growing up.  I hit high school, and while many of my middle school friends discovered cigarettes, pot, and possibly armagnac (The Amber Drink), I found Pepsi.<br /><br />I became addicted to Pepsi.  I drank about three to five cans a day, with a Josta every 2 pm during my Physics class in 1996.  Crystal was a dream come true.<br /><br />* Pepsi is sweeter than Coke<br />* Even when served at the recommended 40Â° F, Pepsi becomes flat faster than Coke.  At sea level, Pepsi, in my opinion, is practically non-consumable.<br />* Pepsi contains 39mg of caffeine as opposed to Coke's 45mg<br />* Pepsi rivals Coke with their strange, alternative soda releases, such as Crystal Pepsi, Crystal with Citrus, Josta, Pepsi Blue, and Pepsi Holiday Spice.  None of these lasted, unfortunately (or were limited productions).  Popular flavors of this soda that continue to last are Wild Cherry Pepsi, Pepsi Twist and Pepsi Vanilla.<br />* Pepsi is less expensive than Coke<br />* Where Coke's holiday marketing is comprised mainly of St. Nicholas, Pepsi's is more apropos with their blue color: ice, winterscapes, snowflakes, and cartoony reindeer characters<br /><br />I always feel, because of Pepsi's modern (and vertical) logo on the can, like I am drinking a container of potential energy.  Like I was holding a 12 oz. consumable battery.  This sleek logo (recently aligned with a 3D-shaded red-white-blue sphere) may be an additional reason for Pepsi being America's second-favorite cola.  It is not as nostalgic as Coca-Cola's cursive logo, which hearkens back to the halcyon days of our older generation (and potential customers).\",\n",
       " 'This stuff is amazing.  I can\\'t quite conceive of Earth having a modern history without this drink.<br /><br />I was never allowed sodas while growing up, so sodas sort of became something special for me in high school (when I could buy them whenever I wanted).  Probably because of this, I drink Coke on practically a daily basis now.<br /><br />* Coke has \"sharper\" carbonation than Pepsi<br />* Coke is tangier, less sweet<br />* Do not drink canned Coke directly after eating pepperoni pizza - the taste disappears, and for some reason the carbonation is more painful<br />* Coke does not go flat as quickly as Pepsi, and this is especially true at ocean level<br />* Canned Coke tastes better than bottled Coke.  Fountain Coke is a good compromise<br />* According to William Poundstone\\'s book, \"Big Secrets,\" the de-cocainization process cannot remove 100% of the cocaine.  In effect, you have to drink 25 million gallons of Coke a day to introduce 1 ounce of cocaine into your body.  In reality, cocaine *was* completely alleviated from the cola in 1925, when the above statement was probably true.<br />* Coke is less aggressive with the alternative soda market, competing with Pepsi\\'s strange new sodas only by releasing New Coke, and Coke II.  These ultimately failed (like Pepsi\\'s sodas).  New flavors that probably won\\'t disappear quickly are Cherry Coke, Vanilla Coke, Diet Coke with Lemon, Diet Coke with Lime, Coke with Lime.<br />* Coke responded to Pepsi\\'s 3D red-white-blue sphere logo with a 3D rendition of the Coca-Cola bottle cap.  This stays inline with Coke\\'s marketing ploy of utilizing (and still selling) the old glass bottles<br /><br />Coke is the drink of the Holidays, as well!  The company has often combined the red can and the jolly face of St. Nick.  In my opinion, the cursive style of Coca-Cola\\'s logo is more nostalgic compared to Pepsi\\'s modern (and vertical) cans.  Undoubtedly, this affects the older generation\\'s market.<br /><br />Recent surveys have found that Root Beer is a little better for your teeth than other sodas (because, you know, I soak my teeth in it every night before going to bed), and that AriZona Green Tea is actually the worst of all drinks (to cause tooth decay)!',\n",

The Senso does that, but it's not better than espresso.  Maybe as good, that's for you to determine.<br /><br />That's the usual tradeoff: fast (easy), cheap, and good: pick any two.  That is my Shiny scale (see below).<br /><br />Ok, I can pick up these 18-pack pods about $4-5 in the supermarkets.  Why pay more with Amazon?  You live in Alaska or something?<br /><br />If you like the other makers' pods, go ahead and buy them.  I've had the Cafe Express ones in my Senseo, and they work fine.  I've also brewed some bag green tea in it, though it can seep out the sides if you're not careful.  You can NOT use tamped coffee, however.  Tried it, and cleaned up the mess afterward.<br /><br />The purist complaint with the Senseo is that their coffees are not up to barista standard.  I don't know who is writing their stuff, but I have been drinking coffee since 9, and I like it so much that my drip brewer sits in the corner.  It's not espresso, but it doesn't' claim to be.  This system is worth more than what I paid for it at Costco, which was $40 at Xmas.  Actually, it was a Xmas gift, so technically I didn't buy it.<br /><br />I think the dark roast is better than the medium, but I do like the mild roast when I am in the mood for nothing shocking.  I have tried the flavored coffee, but think I'd rather add flavored syrup.<br /><br />The system brews at 3 bar, or thereabouts, and true espresso machines will be over 7 bar.  Also, it's pumping steaming water thru, not just steam, but will produce a very pleasant crema (that oil/coffee foam at the top of the glass).  Add milk before, there is no steamer/milk foamer.<br /><br />If you want a real espresso machine, buy a $500 one (Rancilio Silva is the my recommendation at that price range) and learn how to be a barista (10 hours of practice, working at Starbucks, or take a class).  Amortize the cost of the machine over 20 years and you'll be wildly happy.  The Senseo will likely last 4-5 years, I guess, but if it's for occasional good coffee, better than your drip system can produce, you'll be well pleased.  I recommend it, and I have one.<br /><br />Shiny scale:<br /><br />Fast/easy: 9<br /><br />Good: 7<br /><br />cheap (value): 8<br /><br />And for comparison, the Rancilio Silva is:<br /><br />Fast:easy: 7<br /><br />Good: 10\",\n",

One cube (mine are x's - neato) made the juice darker and richer and the flavor of the gravy was better than I'm used to getting with pork chops and also more of it.  For good measure, I gave it a couple drops of Kitchen Boquet.  I know they're just bullion cubes, but these are about the size of 2 American ones which never did a whole lot for me.\",\n",
       " \"My husband is gluten intolerant and as with all gluten free products out there the results are not always the best.  He loves this product and since I only really make the pancakes I can't say how the other Bisquick recipes would turn out for any of you.  And yes he has this texture and taste thing with gluten free products as well...  gritty, sandy or off tasting.... etc. etc...  So I am happy he likes this one!  With gluten free products you really have to test them out one by one as some perform in the taste and texture area better than other blends.  My advice to anyone searching for gluten free products they want to try that it is best to buy them in the single packages, if possible.  I know on Amazon they sell them in bulk but if you find that you don't like it you are then stuck with alot of packages you no longer want!  Just a tip for all of you out there.  It may cost more for one package but the waste will be much less unless you donate them to the local food bank...  Good product and great results!  Thank you, Bisquick!\",\n",

       " 'This is the only litter I will use. (Actually, I prefer the unscented version but I bought the scented this time.) When I think of the definition of a clumping litter, I think of this stuff. The clumps are so solid; it doesn\\'t make a difference whether the clump was made from piddle or poo. It also clumps using a minimal amount of litter, which makes the litter last so much longer than any other brand. The clumps don\\'t crack, crumble, or fall apart in any way when I\\'m scooping. My cat is obsessed with digging and kicking the litter around, and keeps her box pristine. She will continue to bury until she can\\'t smell her waste; with stinky, weak litter this means she pretty much never stops burying. With this litter, she is satisfied after two or so kicks! She also likes to \\'organize\\' her box... seriously, she will go back and make sure all the piddle cakes are on one side, all the poo cakes on another, and all the clean litter in the back corners. With weak crumbly litter, she will break up all the urine clumps into tiny pieces during this process causing the whole thing to smell worse since the tiny pieces are harder to scoop. With this litter, she can push around the clumps to her hearts content and they never break!! It also sticks to her paws much less than other litters I\\'ve tried. Its tiny weightless grains of clay also stay in the box when she kicks and digs, unlike other brands that have huge chunks of clay that hit the wall and floor with every kick. (There\\'s still a lot of litter around the box, but that really has nothing to do with the litter. My cats a digger/ kicker/ flinger.) When I pour the litter in, there is a bit of dust. Its not a lingering menacing cloud like someone else said, that\\'s so exaggerated. Its just a little dust. There is no dust cloud when my kitty paws around in it, and no dust cloud when I scoop. The scent is not nearly as potent (aka nauseating!) as other litters I\\'ve tried, but I still don\\'t like it. Like I said, I usually get the unscented. Speaking of smells... the first time I used fresh step (after using a really gross store brand that was on sale) my cat seemed to be really confused. She always piddles right after I scoop the box, or after I clean it and change the litter. The first time she used this, she piddled, then buried it completely with only two kicks. When shes burying, she kicks a couple times and then goes back and checks if she can smell it, and repeats until its buried. She was absolutely confused by the fact that the pee had \\'disappeared\\' in sight and in smell. She started to try to dig it back up! She looked like she was thinking, \"I know I just peed here... didn\\'t I?? Where the heck did it go?!\" It took her several potty visits to realize that the waste was not just disappearing. Since using fresh step, I\\'ve only used a different brand one time... it was a disaster. She was clearly disgusted by the feel of the litter and the fact that it smelled horrible (and I scoop every day). After two days with that bad litter, she refused to use her box. She had an accident for the very first time. Since then, I\\'ve only bought this stuff. My cat is content and I am quite pleased.',\n",

       " \"Last year after my then 2-year-old pug had several successive skin rashes, my vet suggested that we put him on a limited ingredient diet that cut out corn and other grains and instead used potatoes as the carbohydrate source. After trying a couple different brands and formulations, I finally found the one that worked best for our pug was Natural Balance LID Potato & Duck Formula.<br /><br />The kibble is a small oval-shaped disk. It's fairly flat and measures just a hair over half an inch wide. I read that they also have it available in a smaller size for small breed dogs. But my pug, which has a fairly small mouth, seems to have no problem eating this kibble.<br /><br />We once tried another brand of limited ingredient dog food from Royal Canin that contained rabbit and potato. I didn't like that one because the kibble had a strong smell. This one from Natural Balance does not.<br /><br />I was very pleased to see within one month that our pug's skin was free of redness and irritation. When we were gone on vacation for over a week Spanky got nothing else other than this food (no treats!) and his skin showed rapid and remarkable improvement. It seemed fairly obvious that we had finally found a suitable food for him. He hasn't had any gassiness and his stool is not loose or showing any sign of intestinal distress. Spanky will eat pretty much anything, so it's hard to say if he enjoys this food any more than another brand as he basically inhales his food. However, it does seem to keep him full and from begging for so many treats. To me this is usually a good indicator of a quality food, as it doesn't just go right through him like corn-based foods do.<br /><br />Definitely a 5-star food.\",\n",
       " \"The Roland oil cured olives are quite good. They are as good as any oil cured olives that I have made. It is actually pretty easy if you live in a place where olives grow. The term 'oil cured olives' is a bit of a misnomer. This type of olive is actually salt cured not oil cured. First very ripe black olives are picked from the tree, washed and towel dried. They are then packed in a crock in thin layers with kosher salt between each layer. After a few weeks the salt draws all the water out of the olives leaving then looking like small prunes. The next step is to wash the olives very thoroughly to remove most of the salt. Then they are dried with a towel to remove any water. Next place the olives in a bowl and mix with enough good olive oil to coat the olives. They are now ready to eat. They can be kept in the refigerator for many month. So as you can see oil cured olives are actually salt cured. The olive oil is absolutely not a curing agent. It is added to make the olives more palatable. This may explain why, so called 'oil cured olives' are a bit salty for some tastes. As many reviewers have mentinoned the Roland olives can be rinsed, dried with a towel then re-oiled with olive oil. This will produce an olive with much less salt. I frankly think that the Roland oilves aren't too salty and they are a good value when compared to grocery store oil cured olives.\",\n",

We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes. They are potato, but popped like popcorn and sort of puffy like rice cakes. They definitely have more flavor than many rice cakes and are a nice alternative to popcorn.

It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.)

Christmas was upon us, and gingerbread sounded good.  We purchased it at ALDI (a special buy) in December.  The expiration date was April 2013, so there\\'s no question it was fresh.  I tried the gingerbread cake recipe on the side of the box.  Following the directions exactly, I mixed the ingredients and baked the cake at the recommended temperature until a toothpick inserted in the center came out clean.<br /><br />The first thing we noticed was the smell.  Gingerbread typically has a strong odor, but this was beyond strong.  It had an overbearing \"perfumy\" chemical odor that burned your nostrils.  After it cooled we served it with a little whipped cream.  We each tentatively took a bite and pushed it aside.  My throat burned for several minutes, and I could still taste it the next morning.  Needless to say we threw the rest of it out.<br /><br />This is not the first Krusteaz product we\\'ve wasted eggs, other ingredients, time, and money on.  We\\'ve tried their blueberry bread/muffin mix (extremely heavy), raspberry bars (heavy, perfumy), lemon bars (a soggy mess), some kind of orange bars (tough and dry), and chocolate chunk cookies (fell flat).  Without exception every Krusteaz product we\\'ve tried has been inedible.  The thing is our current oven is the best we\\'ve ever owned.  It bakes evenly and turns out beautiful cakes -- that is, when the cake mix or recipe is good.

There\\'s no date on it, but I don\\'t doubt that it\\'s out of date since it\\'s been in the pantry for a couple of years.  We had bought two boxes at the same time and tried one immediately only to have to throw out the whole pan.  I was just cleaning out the pantry and decided to call the company after the latest failure to deliver by one of their over-priced products (the gingerbread).  All they could offer was a coupon for a replacement Krusteaz product.  Thanks but no thanks.

I had all but written Gloria Jean off as a weak coffee brand when my boyfriend's sister gave us a few of her Butter Toffee k cups to try out, insisting they were much better than the Hazelnut.  At that point I hadn't tried another butter toffee flavored coffee from any of the other brands, so I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />What a letdown.<br /><br />Butter toffee does smell like its namesake when it is being brewed.  I had a lot of hope for it because of how it made my kitchen smell during the brewing process.  The flavor follow-up was nothing short of weak, though.  For one thing, I couldn't detect any butter toffee flavor in the coffee itself at all.  Shame.  The other downside is that, instead of being just a slightly boring, but good cup of regular coffee, this one somehow managed to be bitter and weak at the same time.  Nothing robust or flavorful about it.  Just weak coffee with a terrible aftertaste.<br /><br />So I've only had the chance to try two of Gloria Jean's flavors so far, but I definitely won't be going out of my way to try any others.

It isn't even posted on the Godiva website. Of all the people I've served this too, I have never had someone dislike it, even those who said they don't drink flavored coffee.

We have tried most of the other varieties of Popchips and have our own preferences. My older daughter likes salt and pepper, barbecue, and this flavor the best. I like barbecue, sour cream and onion, and this flavor the best. My wife likes salt and vinegar and this flavor the best. My younger daughter does not like this flavor. She prefers barbecue, cheese, and sour cream and onion. Our least favorite is the original, probably because it is so plain by comparison.<br /><br />To me, Popchips are sort of a cross of potato chips, popcorn, and rice cakes.

So my search lead me to Amazon for quantity, price and purity. I looked at many options here, and found this one. For me, the taste is a plus, but some might find it a problem. It has a fairly obvious coconut flavor to it, so if you are picky about flavors added to the food you are cooking, this could be a problem for you. I haven't found it to be a problem, myself. My wife won't cook with it because she is generally not looking to add a coconut flavor to most of what she adds oil to. I find that it is even a good flavor if I should occasionally choose to eat a tablespoon of oil directly. At room temperature, (at least during the winter) the oil is solid, and it melts in my mouth. It has a nice smooth texture, with that coconut taste. The color is nice white, like the inside of a coconut. It is supposed to be stable at higher temperatures. I believe it provides a good supply of the Omega-3 fatty acids, which I understand a lot of us may not get enough of. (We tend to get too much of the Omega-6.) I read of a low-carb recipe for chocolate lard, and thought it would work well with this coconut oil instead of lard. (Haven't tried it yet.) I heartily recommend this oil if you are looking for organic, pure, not hydrogenated coconut oil at a good price, (unless you don't want the coconut taste.)\",\n",

       " \"After an awful experience with those vile tasting Grove Square wannabee Keurig cups, I was very hesitant to try anything but authentic 'K-Cup (tm)' coffee portions.  I had been eyeballing these San Francisco Bay brand here on Amazon for awhile, but hadn't purchased them.  When I saw them at Costco (by the way, they sell them in a box of 80 for about $25), I decided to take the plunge.  And they're not bad.<br /><br />As mentioned by others, the 'cup' design is essentially a paper filter filled with coffee grounds and then attached to the underside of a plastic ring which fits into the Keurig brewer.  The top is sealed off with the traditional thick foil which is pierced by the top needle of the Keurig brewer.  The bottom needle which pierces the bottom of the standard K Cups does not even come into play with these as the water is forced into the grounds.  The coffee passes through from the filter and then directly out the bottom of the  k cup holder and into the coffee cup.<br /><br />Like every traditional K-Cup these are a bit on the weak side, especially as you increase the cup size on your brewer, but I usually brew at the 8 oz setting and I thought these were acceptable.  It does have the (for lack of a better word) 'burnt' French Roast flavor which is surprisinly absent from most so-called 'dark roast' K-Cups and that is much appreciated.<br /><br />My only issues with these cups are the freshness issues.  Since the coffee is basicaly hanging out in the open air (only the paper filter separates it from the outside world) they will change taste very quickly.  I saw someone mention that the Amazon package has them in individual bags of 12.  The bos from Costco has them in individual bags of 8, so of course the manufacturer is aware of the issue of them going bad more quickly.  I personally would prefer they be bagged with quantities no more than 4 or 5 - the quantity I would use up in 2 or 3 days.  I don't have one, I think they look tacky, but if you have one of those 'Carousels' on your counter to display your k cups, I think this product would be completely incompatible with it.  My other issue is that since this coffee drips directly from the filter into the k cup holder on the machine, the holder will have to be washed regularly (probably daily) lest the coffee oils build up and change the final coffee taste even more..<br /><br />I'm generally happy with this product though, and probably will buy it again. with proper storage in an airtight container, I think the economical price evens out the freshness issues.\",\n",

This product is low sugar, low calorie and it has no artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners. Its organic so no pesticide residue and no genetically modified ingredients. The small foil packet is easy to transport and can be mixed to your taste preference: 8oz water for a sweet drink, 12-16oz water for medium sweetness, 20oz water for a flavored water drink. Cheaper than buying a bottled drink of this sort - especially with the subscribe and save option from Amazon. Absolutely love that this takes a disposable plastic drink bottle out of the equation! I usually drink this at home when I feel a cold coming on so I can mix it in glass. The packet is easy to open and easy to mix - just pull the perforated tab at the top off and pour into a glass of water or your own water bottle. Makes a great smoothie base too. This helped solve the problem of how to take psyllium husk and make it taste decent: mix a packet with 12 oz water, pour off 8 oz (save the other 4 oz to drink later) and add 1 rounded tsp psyllium husk, let sit to thicken.

       " \"My only foray into Gloria Jean's brand of k cups before this one was when I tried the Hazelnut flavor that was included in the sample pack that was included with our new brewer.  Needless to say, I was unimpressed with it.  I had all but written Gloria Jean off as a weak coffee brand when my boyfriend's sister gave us a few of her Butter Toffee k cups to try out, insisting they were much better than the Hazelnut.  At that point I hadn't tried another butter toffee flavored coffee from any of the other brands, so I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />What a letdown.<br /><br />Butter toffee does smell like its namesake when it is being brewed.  I had a lot of hope for it because of how it made my kitchen smell during the brewing process.  The flavor follow-up was nothing short of weak, though.  For one thing, I couldn't detect any butter toffee flavor in the coffee itself at all.  Shame.  The other downside is that, instead of being just a slightly boring, but good cup of regular coffee, this one somehow managed to be bitter and weak at the same time.  Nothing robust or flavorful about it.  Just weak coffee with a terrible aftertaste.<br /><br />So I've only had the chance to try two of Gloria Jean's flavors so far, but I definitely won't be going out of my way to try any others.  I'll stick to Timothy's and Caribou Coffee from now on.\",\n",

His skin showed vast improvement but we still wanted to try these as he seemed as bit bored with the Duck & Potato treats.<br /><br />These treats are available in both regular size and the smaller size for small breeds. We got the small breed size, which measures roughly 1.25 inches long and is shaped like a dog bone.<br /><br />I notice the smoked hickory flavor right away. Spanky loves them. The size is perfect for his small mouth and he's able to chew them in one bite without me breaking them in half.  However, they do break in half easily, so if you're doing training with your dog and don't want to overstuff them with treats, you could break these into two pieces.<br /><br />I give him treats several times a day. On a typical day he probably gets about 6 of these, at the minimum, and sometimes a bit more. The skin on his belly (which is where he'd been having a lot of irritation) is still in good shape, so obviously he can do well with sweet potato. His stool hasn't shown any changes, either, so these treats appear to be a good fit for him.<br /><br />We continue to be pleased with the quality of food from Natural Balance. I highly recommend these treats for dogs with sensitive skin or other sensitivities to grain-based foods. 5 stars.\",\n",

So when I saw watermelon berry as a flavor with Switch and that it was pure juice besides, I had to try it and all their flavors.  Overall, the watermelon doesn\\'t disappoint and does remind me of that soda, but probably better having real juice in it.  But all the flavors, in addition to the described flavors have added juices to them that have nothing to do with the flavor (i.e. apple and acerola).  For flavors like lemon and lime this makes sense because if they didn\\'t have other juices added they would be very sour with no added sugar, but it is disappointing for flavors like grape where those additions clearly subtract from the \"grape juice\" flavor, which I\\'d prefer to be stronger.  Even so, it still tastes better than grape soda and grape is the strongest flavor.  None of the flavors here are \\'bad\\' at all.  All taste better than flavored soda, IMO and have to be much better for you with plenty of vitamin C and no added sugar (fructose is better for you than sucrose).

For the past couple of years he\\'s been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips.

       " 'Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.

For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ\">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0\">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that\\'s a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.

       " 'Black mustard seeds provide a potent kick to many Eastern and Western cuisines.  I use them to make homemade prepared mustard -- easy as can be and much better than store-bought varieties.  There are three general categories of mustard seed: white, brown, and black.  White is the least potent, and black is the most. Brown is in the middle.  I like my homemade prepared mustard to have a complex depth of flavor, so I use all three types.  The mustard-y properties of the seeds are activated by water, which provides another way to control the potency of the mixture: adding cold water will yield a stronger mustard, while warmer water will mellow the taste.<br /><br />The most simple preparation of mustard is Chinese-style, which is just a mixture of powdered mustard seed, water, and a dash of oil.<br /><br />Basic Prepared Mustard Recipe<br /><br />1 measure* of mustard seed (one type or a mix of all three)<br />1 measure of liquid (can be water only or a mix of water with other ingredients such as wine, beer, vinegar -- I like to use 1/2 measure of ice cold water, 1/4 to 1/2 measure of cold white wine, and up to 1/4 measure of homemade wine vinegar)<br />1 teaspoon good quality oil (extra virgin olive oil)<br /><br />* A \"measure\" can be any set volume amount.  I typically make about 1 cup at a time, so my \"measure\" is 1/2 cup.<br /><br />Preparation:<br /><br />Place the mustard seeds in a glass bowl (I use this type: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y9AJB4\">Snapware Glasslock Glass Storage Containers with Lids 18pc Set Nesting Design</a>) and add the liquid ingredients.  Cover and soak in the refrigerator overnight.<br /><br />The next day, place the contents of the bowl in a blender or food processor and pulse until most of the seeds are bruised or crushed.<br /><br />If you want a grainy mustard (\"whole grain\" mustard) remove 1/2 to 2/3 of the mustard and place back into the soaking jar.  Then, continue to pulse or blend the mustard that remains in the blender/processor until smooth.  Place the smooth mustard in the bowl and stir to blend.<br /><br />If you want a smoother mustard, just blend/process all of the mustard until the desired consistency is achieved.<br /><br />A word of caution: Do NOT stick your face over the opening of the blender/processor to inhale the aroma of freshly prepared mustard -- you WILL understand why they called it \"Mustard Gas\" in World War I.<br /><br />For more potent mustard, do not allow the blender/processor to heat the mixture.  If needed, stop blending, re-chill the mixture, and blend again.<br /><br />Feel free to add honey, salt to taste, black or white pepper, jalapenos, horseradish or any other flavorings.<br /><br />Keep the mustard in the covered glass container.

       " 'The reason, I suspect, that people have varying results regarding glucose levels after eating Dreamfields concerns overcooking. Their website explains that it must be cooked precisely according to the individual box directions in order to retain the low carb aspect. This should probably be explained on the box as well. The website states:<br /><br />\"It is very important not to overcook Dreamfields because over cooking can damage the protective matrix and increase the digestible carbs per serving. We also recommend pouring any sauce over the pasta just before serving. If the pasta is mixed in a pan with the sauce, do this only over low heat for a short amount of time.\"<br /><br />I don\\'t cook mine even a minute longer than the the recommended time.<br /><br />With the exception of the lasagna noodles, it\\'s not recommended for storage after cooking, either. The company recommends only preparing what you will consume at the time. Storage in a sauce, especially an acidic sauce (like one with tomatoes or vinegar), will also break down the protective matrix which prevents digestion.<br /><br />Needless to say, portion control is important, too.

       " 'Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ\">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0\">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that\\'s a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon\\'s convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.',\n",

       " 'I had my heart set on making all my own baby food, so I bought this baby food maker a few months ago.  I had never made baby food before, and in hindsight I think I would have done things a little differently.  I am hoping that my experience might be helpful to someone else in determining whether he/she wants to buy the Beaba.<br /><br />First of all, the Beaba is a great little machine and very convenient.  I just prep the food, throw it in, add the water, and let it do its thing until it\\'s time to blend it up.  It\\'s nice that it\\'s all in one machine and I don\\'t have to get any other dishes dirty.  It\\'s also very reliable.  I can\\'t even tell you how many times I have used it in the last few months.  Some days I use it 5-7 times and it just chugs on.<br /><br />That said, in my opinion it has a very small capacity.  That might not matter to you and you might not even notice.  It all depends on your style and how you want to feed your baby.  So far, I have come across two styles of grinding up your own baby food:<br /><br />1)  Steaming and grinding up baby food multiple times a week, possibly before every meal.  Some people really enjoy sharing whatever they are eating with their baby.  They prep it and feed it to their baby a few minutes later.<br /><br />2)  Steaming and grinding up baby food less often, but making larger amounts of food.  Some people want to have baby food on hand all the time.  They make a large amount of food, freeze it in ice cube trays, keep it in the freezer and thaw cubes before every meal.<br /><br />I think there are advantages to both styles, but I personally veer toward making larger batches of food and freezing it so I have it on hand.  If you are like me, the Beaba isn\\'t your best option.  Get a nice Cuisinart with a larger capacity(or use the one you already have).  If you are worried about how to steam the food (I used to think I would have to do it on the stove), you can put it in a microwave safe dish with some water and steam it in the microwave.<br /><br />When I was particularly overwhelmed, a friend recommended that I get the \"Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food Kit.\"  If you\\'re interested in making large batches of food, it can completely set you straight.  It comes with a video, a book, a handy laminated reference chart and two ice cube trays.  The video was incredibly cheesy, but it made me feel like I knew what I was doing in about 45 minutes.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.  Good luck!',\n",

My husband got sick several times & I kept telling him to drnk the tea!  The last time he finally listened & ended up not even missing any days at work. He keeps a box for himself at work now. You don't have to be sick tho, it's a great tasting tea...even if you don't like green tea. And the bonus is that it's good for you!\",\n",
       " \"I've been using xylitol for a few years now.  It has many health benefits and dental uses, do a web search for yourself and see how great this stuff is!  It's an excellent sugar alternative for those of us with diabetes.  We can indulge our sweet tooth without the negative consequences.  Until recently I didn't know that so much of the xylitol on the market was made in China from corn that is likely genetically modified.  Sorry, I'm not about to put those mystery granules in my body.  This product by Health Garden is made in the USA from birch.  Sure, you're going to pay more for this than you will for the other stuff, but at least you know what you're getting.  This sweetener tastes identical to sugar, though the granules are a bit larger (not a problem, just an observation).  You can use it exactly like you would use sugar, but be warned, xylitol is dangerous for pets, so if your furry companions have a sweet tooth, don't give them anything made with xylitol!  Also, too much xylitol will loosen your bowels.  Xylitol is a sugar alcohol and your body does not process it like it does ordinary sugar.  My only question is, why did the price go up $15 in a week?  The 10 lb. bag was $39.99 when I ordered it last week, now it's $54.99.  That's quite a jump.  I'm glad I ordered it when I did.\",\n",

       " 'Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ\">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0\">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that\\'s a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon\\'s convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.',\n",

Almost everything I read from online resource sites kept saying to trust my baby and my body. Your body will produce what baby needs based on supply and demand.

Almost everything I read from online resource sites kept saying to trust my baby and my body. Your body will produce what baby needs based on supply and demand. This wasn't working out so great for me. I breastfed full time from the day he was born and through his first month to establish my supply as the resources also stated. As well as pumped on occasion. Even then, however, my baby would fuss at nearly every feeding, especially when I had to feed on my right breast. How could I be expected to relax and just let the milk *slowly* come (drop by drop by drop) while my son is all but crying from hunger with my nipple in his mouth? It broke my heart! These pills turned out to be a life saver! Now he's 7 weeks old and I can pump 4.5 to 7oz per session and still feed him within 2hrs of pumping with no problems.

We also recommend pouring any sauce over the pasta just before serving. If the pasta is mixed in a pan with the sauce, do this only over low heat for a short amount of time.\"<br /><br />I don\\'t cook mine even a minute longer than the the recommended time.<br /><br />With the exception of the lasagna noodles, it\\'s not recommended for storage after cooking, either.

       " 'Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ\">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0\">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that\\'s a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon\\'s convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.',\n",

Rather than going cold turkey (or cold tofu maybe?), I figured I\\'ll try to work in one or two vegetarian meals into my week. That isn\\'t so easy when you feel like there\\'s nothing to satisfy that chew, that texture that only meat seems to exhibit. Enter Textured Vegetable Protein. When I first heart of it, I thought \"what a weird sounding product\". But reviews said it provides a meat-like texture in meals, and it was cheap, so I figured why not. While TVP may not look too appealing (soylent green anyone?), and the smell when raw is a bit unpleasant, it is a wonderful product. It really does have the texture of ground meat when reconstituted in boiling liquids. And just like tofu, it\\'s a flavor sponge, adapting to any spice or flavor you throw at it (warning: throwing spices at something could be a messy affair). I\\'ve made tacos, chilli, used it for spaghetti and meatballs, and made some pretty good veggie burgers with it. I also took the suggestion of using it to extend the ground turkey I had in my house, so even my meat meals are turning vegetarian!<br /><br />I know I\\'m barely cracking the surface of what this stuff can be used for. I just want to say to any meat eater considering going the vegetarian route, it\\'s not all gloom and doom. TVP will help you out. In fact, you can say TVP = The Vegetarian Pathway (I just made that up while typing, but it seemed fitting!).

The flavor is mostly lemonade with a hint of tea (much like the \"Half and Half\" teas on the market).  Unlike most drinks sweetened with sucralose there was no chemical aftertaste.  The energy rush from the drink took about 10-20 minutes to set in and lasted about 2.5 hours.  Although most of the people I know use Rehab as a coffee replacer in the mornings (lemonade with the effects of coffee is a great way to start the day), I drink this every weekend so I can stay up late with my family.<br /><br />As much as I like this drink, I wouldn\\'t buy it from Amazon at the price they are listing.

       " 'I had my heart set on making all my own baby food, so I bought this baby food maker a few months ago.  I had never made baby food before, and in hindsight I think I would have done things a little differently.  I am hoping that my experience might be helpful to someone else in determining whether he/she wants to buy the Beaba.<br /><br />First of all, the Beaba is a great little machine and very convenient.  I just prep the food, throw it in, add the water, and let it do its thing until it\\'s time to blend it up.  It\\'s nice that it\\'s all in one machine and I don\\'t have to get any other dishes dirty.  It\\'s also very reliable.  I can\\'t even tell you how many times I have used it in the last few months.  Some days I use it 5-7 times and it just chugs on.<br /><br />That said, in my opinion it has a very small capacity.  That might not matter to you and you might not even notice.  It all depends on your style and how you want to feed your baby.  So far, I have come across two styles of grinding up your own baby food:<br /><br />1)  Steaming and grinding up baby food multiple times a week, possibly before every meal.  Some people really enjoy sharing whatever they are eating with their baby.  They prep it and feed it to their baby a few minutes later.<br /><br />2)  Steaming and grinding up baby food less often, but making larger amounts of food.  Some people want to have baby food on hand all the time.  They make a large amount of food, freeze it in ice cube trays, keep it in the freezer and thaw cubes before every meal.<br /><br />I think there are advantages to both styles, but I personally veer toward making larger batches of food and freezing it so I have it on hand.  If you are like me, the Beaba isn\\'t your best option.  Get a nice Cuisinart with a larger capacity(or use the one you already have).  If you are worried about how to steam the food (I used to think I would have to do it on the stove), you can put it in a microwave safe dish with some water and steam it in the microwave.<br /><br />When I was particularly overwhelmed, a friend recommended that I get the \"Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food Kit.\"  If you\\'re interested in making large batches of food, it can completely set you straight.  It comes with a video, a book, a handy laminated reference chart and two ice cube trays.  The video was incredibly cheesy, but it made me feel like I knew what I was doing in about 45 minutes.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.  Good luck!',\n",

Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0\">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that\\'s a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.

As a result, I was able to plan for my older cat and order enough of the food from several sources to get her through the shortage (unless it lasts longer than presently expected).  Given her age and the veterinary condition, it might have saved her life if it enables me to avoid having to switch her to another food.  All of the cans received were in good condition.

Making fresh spice pastes every time I\\'m cooking is just not practical, which means that I don\\'t get to make the dishes as often as I might like, so I jumped at the opportunity to try a pre-packaged version of a dish that typically takes several hours to make.<br /><br />Rendang is usually a slow cooking dish. The directions here make it easy to make on a weeknight at home. Overall, the sauce makes a generous portion. While the \"safety information\" (allergy alert) mentions \"crustacean\", the ingredient list doesn\\'t include belechan (shrimp paste), which is typically used for rendang. I also didn\\'t taste it in the packaged sauce, so it is lacking a bit of authentic taste. However, that\\'s easy enough to rememdy by adding your own when heating the spice paste. It was not as spicy as I would\\'ve liked, or as I expected.<br /><br />For the record, I also tried it as a slow cooker with beef stew pieces. That makes the taste slightly more authentic, as the beef was more thoroughly infused with the rendang flavor. I\\'d definitely substitute the coconut milk powder with a can (I used two) of coconut milk. I also added some more oelek sambal (chili) to give it more kick and some belechan. Those changes produced something that was almost perfection.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, I\\'d prefer for this to be sold as a paste packet or  similar to Mae Ploy/Aroy-D/Asian Home Gourmet  so that I can add my own milk (and belechan). However, for the ease of making the dish and for relatively authentic flavor, I give this four stars.',\n",
       " \"I enjoy cooking meals from scratch, but I understand that curry can be somewhat of a hassle because it often requires a lot of specialty spices like white pepper and candlenut. So it makes a lot of sense to prepackage these ingredients into a simple curry kit like this Prima Taste product, and they've definitely done a good job of making it easy.<br /><br />The box includes a rendering paste and a coconut premix, and the only extra ingredients you need is beef (they suggest 28oz of sliced beef tenderloin) and water. After cooking the beef, you just need to bring the water, with included rendering paste and coconut premix, to a boil. Add the beef, then serve - you'll need to supply your own side of rice. Pretty simple.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredient list, I was also pleasantly surprised. The rendering paste doesn't seem to have any additives at all. The coconut pre-mix, on the other hand, does contain maltodextrin and sodium caseinate, but it mostly just seems to be powdered coconut milk - if this is a problem, I suppose you substitute some canned (or homemade) coconut milk (though you'd probably want to nix the water too).<br /><br />I'm no expert on curry, but it smells and tastes very much like I'd expected. Perhaps somebody who grew up eating curry all their life might be able to tell the difference, but I sure wasn't. It had a nice coconut flavor and wasn't very spicy. If I were to make this again, I would probably add some fresh vegetables - maybe onion, garlic, and peppers - but overall I was very happy with this product.\",\n",

Most important, you don\\'t get that \"sawdusty\" or \"cardboardy\" taste that fiber cereals often have.<br /><br />The reason for that is two-fold. First, while it is a decent source of fiber it\\'s not nearly as much as cereals such as All-Bran.  This has 7 g of fiber per serving (1 cup), which is 28% of the recommended daily amount. Decent, but not fantastic.<br /><br />It also has quite a bit of sugar - 10g per serving. That\\'s nearly as much as Frosted Flakes - it has 11g of sugar, and is commonly considered to be the archetypical \"sugary kids cereal.\" So if you\\'re looking to keep your sugar intake low, this probably is not a good choice.<br /><br />Calories are also a bit high at 160 per serving (dry cereal).<br /><br />Despite these issues I\\'m still pretty pleased with this, mainly because I don\\'t have to mix it with another cereal to make it taste good, as I often have to do with other high bran cereals.

       " 'For the Holidays last year, I decided to forgo the legitimate Pumpkin Pie and try something a bit lighter/healthier. I\\'m familiar with Jell-O\\'s No Bake line, such as their delicious No Bake cheesecake, so I figured their Pumpkin Pie (style) mix should be good too. Well, it\\'s not. At first taste, I thought \"that\\'s not bad!\", but after a few mouthfuls of it, I could barely stand it anymore. There are two main problems I find with it. First of all, the consistency is off, it doesn\\'t really get to a Pie consistency, more like pudding as another reviewer mentioned. I\\'ve added less milk (1.5 cups) and that helped a bit with the texture (now more like thicker pudding). Second, in order to compensate for the lack of any real Pumpkin, Kraft put wayy too much ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg or whatever else in there. The pumpkin spice flavor is overly pronounced and upsets my stomach after a few spoonfuls. So now I\\'m stuck with a few boxes of this stuff trying to figure out how to use it and/or get rid of it.  At the very least, I could use the included crust mixes for another one of Jell-O\\'s better flavors.',\n",

I decided to try a bottled one in order to save the time it takes to make it at home. After reading the 1st and only review for this product (which was a 5 star...I think the customer might have been trying to get someone else sucked into buying it!), I decided to try it. I purchased 4 jars. BIG mistake! This is the WORST TASTING Hollandaise I could ever imagine! Tried it at room temp, then tried heating it to see if the bitter taste would go away but to no avail. This stuff is horrible! The only nice thing about the product is the shape of the jar. I'm going to make a huge batch of my own home made Hollandaise and store it in the jars. Thought about giving the three unopened jars away, but I don't have any enemies I hate THAT much! I poured their contents down the toilet (hope it doesn't ruin my sewage system!) and thoroughly washed the bottles for my own use.<br />If you're looking to have a great Hollandaise sauce at home, I highly recommend you MAKE it at home!\",\n",

Six hours later my family and some neighbors attacked it, and every single one of the seven who tried it gave it 5/5 stars for taste.<br /><br />There are two packets to mix into your browned beef cubes -- the first one is a dried coconut milk powder and the second one has all the seasonings: chili, galangal, palm sugar, onion, shallot, sugar, pandan leaf, garlic, candlenut, lemongrass, soy sauce, fennel, coriander, cumin, kaffir lime leaf, cloves, turmeric, white pepper and cinnamon. The box says it contains wheat, too, but I can't see evidence of that in the ingredient list.<br /><br />You simply brown the beef or chicken, add in the contents of both packets, mix well and cook it all until the meat's done. I highly recommend the crockpot method; you can throw it together pretty quickly in the morning and then just steam some rice with it for dinner. Our meat was beautifully easy to shred and spread out the flavor even more.<br /><br />The taste the mix brings to the curry is not your usual/expected taste -- it's a mild, slightly sweet, slightly spicy and extremely flavorful blend. I appreciated the fact that it had no chemical-sounding ingredients, but there is a warning on the label that it in manufactured on equipment that also processes seafood, peanuts, sesame and egg products.<br /><br />The box says a serving size is two tablespoons (15 servings altogether).

       " 'Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ\">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0\">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that\\'s a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon\\'s convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.',\n",

At midpalate the citrus explodes into juicy intensity. At the turn to the finish there\\'s a burst of floral essences - confused and humid like a quick tuck into a steamy raucous flower shop. Then the finish brings the cavalcade of classic maritime flavors up: salt sea air, mineral rock, old attic hatbox wood and a final bitter medicinal iodine note. Wow. I\\'m dizzy just writing it down. This is a tour de force of delicious flavors melded with maritime weird ones. It\\'s totally recognizable as Talisker - the terroir of Skye is all over it.

The puking has decreased dramatically and she seems more satisfied after eatting with this formula plus her coat looks remarkably more shiny.  She eats several mini meals a day.  I\\'ve noticed that helps with the puking situation as well.  I am so happy that Halo created this \"sensitive\" formula, it has really made a positive difference in my cat\\'s overall disposition and health.  Yay Halo and yay Amazon for carrying this formula of Spot\\'s Stew since my local store doesn\\'t carry it!',\n",

       " \"I have not posted a review before, but this so impressed me that I just had to.<br /><br />This stuff is great. It tastes FANTASTIC! And I have noticed some EXTRA, positive, benefits from taking it, too.<br /><br />I cant stop eating it! Seriously, I am craving it (maybe my body needs something that's in it). But what I have also noticed is that after I take it, for maybe 3 or 4 hours, it seems to suppress my appetite and cravings, which I have never had anything do that before. Now I have to MAKE myself eat, sometimes. (Gotta work on THAT one!)<br /><br />I have been having some problems lately (being 45) with my metabolism slowing down and me gaining weight and feeling hungry all the time. -I assume due to getting older and hormones and such.<br /><br />Well, it made me feel like I was not hungry at all. Sometimes I did eat anyway (well, more than I should have, even though I wasnt hungry), which was not smart on my part, but, again ... I will have to work on that one.<br /><br />How? I am going to try to take advantage of it suppressing my appetite to try to eat less and healthier. Maybe this will give me give me the extra help/boost I needed.<br /><br />Maybe I can LIVE on this stuff! (Ha, ha!) I have read all the comments, and someone said it DID help her lose weight.<br /><br />I am taking a tablespoon twice a day (I don't want to take too much). And I will continue this and see how it goes. Maybe add a third one.<br /><br />Oh, and I agree with those others about buying it somewhere else. I got mine at Whole Foods for (I think) about $8 dollars on sale. I was checking here what Amazon wanted, but I will apparently be going back there for more!<br /><br />About making your own ... it IS a bit pricey, but you're getting raw AND organic, so is it really worth it to make your own (buying raw, organic flakes)?<br /><br />Oh, and the OTHER health benefit. -I have been fighting a problem (I am talking on and off for a couple of YEARS) of a yeast combination dermatitis on my hands. It will seem like it is improving, then comes back. I have been at my wits end. Dr.'s and creams and medicine and trying to change my diet (EXTREMELY hard!) and nothing has kept it from going away completely.<br /><br />I read somewhere that coconut oil was a strong antifungal, and when I got the oil at WF's, I saw this and thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />My hands have been improving A LOT.<br /><br />Now I don't know if they will STAY improved, or if it is the CB helping. (I am also taking cinnamon, which I read showed antifungal benefits on fungal infections that were resistant to medications - but I had been taking it before and it didn't help as much as this.) Maybe both together?<br /><br />I don't know, and I don't want to get my hopes up, but I am going to keep trying BOTH of them. I do take pro-biotic's, though they have never seemed to help much.<br /><br />I cant say if it will have the same benefits for everyone as it has me, but I'd say its worth trying. And I admit I have only been using it a week and a half, so I don't know if it will make a difference in the long run or not. (I HOPE so!)<br /><br />Sorry to be so long, but I wanted to be thorough and to explain all of how it helped me.\",\n",

It's great on rice cakes with sliced bananas too.  The texture (without all the peanut fat) is obviously not as heavy/oily as peanut butter, so picky kids used to regular peanut butter might not like it.  I find it very satisfying and remnicent enough of peanut butter that it's a treat without the thought of packing on calories and fat as with regular peanut butter.  I also love it in smoothies, which usually require a ton of peanut butter to even perceive the taste of peanut, but not with this... A few teaspoons and a frozen banana with almond milk and you've got a smoothie to die for without the guilt.  I'm definately reordering this product.  I liked the PB2 Chocolate as well, but it's not as versatile as the PB2.  I only tend to use the chocolate one in smoothies, whereas the plain PB2 can be used and just add a little cocoa when you want it.  I also love how easy this stuff is to take when traveling...

She gorged herself, got sick, & after making her wait until her stomach had settled a little before I put her dish back down, all she would eat was the supermarket food.  If she got a mouthful of this cat food, she'd spit it out & eat ONLY the supermarket food.

The liquid they're packed in stinks, they have a very strange consistency, and they have no flavor.  It took me about a year to figure it out.<br /><br />Drain the noodles and rinse them really well.  Place them in a microwave safe bowl and microwave them (I use the potato setting).  After the first round, drain them in a colander and check the texture, do they still have water in the noodles?  If so, put them back into the microwave and zap them again.  This process removes all of the liquid, and gives the noodles an actual pasta texture and consistency.  And, it allows them to reabsorb whatever sauce you're pairing them with to give them flavor.<br /><br />Once they're ready, you can combine them with ingredients to throw in the oven for an amazing tuna casserole, or throw them into a reduced pasta sauce for an amazing dry spaghetti, or add them at the end of cooking a phad thai.\",\n",

With the factory set position, the bigger gopher will be choked, while the little one will be crushed at the mid section.  The key to successfully use this trap is how to set it.  You have to think like a gopher, and construct this unit into the gopher's existing tunnel.  Then, leave a little opening a bit further down the tunnel.  Gophers' instinct will be to close the opening further down the tunnel, thus activate the trigger.

I am assuming that the honey made it sweet and that an artificial sweetener was not added. If you are going to use it as just a drink, you might try using a half of a packet, but you could also add a whole one to a pitcher of ice tea and still have a nice ginger flavor. I would think that it would also be great to clear out your sinuses. Since many people use ginger for an upset stomach or an aid to digestion, it would be great to make a drink for that purpose.

It also tastes like it has a lot of black pepper in it.  I like that as I usually add pepper to my soup anyway, but some people might not care for it.  The container is a nice size.  It has enough for two servings if you're doing a soup-and-sandwich type thing, but it's large enough for one good meal sized portion if that's all your having.<br /><br />You should note, though, that the container says specifically NOT to microwave the soup in the container.

       " \"the wine saver is great in so many ways. obviously it's wonderful to be able to open a bottle of wine and have it stay good for a day or two, especially if you just like one glass with dinner. this lets you open up and enjoy more expensive wine since you won't waste the whole rest of the bottle. if you are interested in learning about wines, you'll probably want to open up 2 or more wines at a time to compare them, and this way you won't waste anything. the wine saver will keep the undrunk portion until the next time.  i do recommend putting the bottle in the fridge if you don't drink it the next day. just pull the bottle out an hour before you want to drink it if it's red.\",\n",

       " \"few things i'd like to point out:<p>1.  &quot;espresso&quot; is not a roast.  it's a drink.  in northern italy they make espresso from vienna roast, in southern italy they use french.  starbucks appears to be using french roast, so they should just label it french roast like any normal person would.<p>2.  the product description says &quot;taste espresso roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. this is one versatile coffee!&quot;  this is patently absurd.  it's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  here's why:<p>making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  if you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  if you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  you get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.<p>therefore, a &quot;universal grind&quot; is an impossibility.  they should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.<p>3.  it's over-roasted.  starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  then they roast all their beans vienna or french.  most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not vienna or french.  so why roast all your beans too dark?  i guess it's just easier that way.  also, it lets them rename vienna roast as &quot;starbucks roast&quot; because the austrians don't seem to care.<p>that said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.<p>anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:<p>buy a grinder.  nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  if you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  if you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  it's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for starbucks you should invest in one.<p>find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  freshness matters!  good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.<p>ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  most people don't use the right amount.  if you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.\",\n",

       " '\"we use and believe in stone milling because no machinery has yet been developed that grinds grains into flours, cereals, and meals quite as well as the flint-hard quartz stones used by master millers since early roman times.\" ~bob\\'s red mill site<br /><br />the 100 % stone ground whole wheat flour is my favorite flour for use in a variety of whole wheat bread recipes. it is all natural and doesn\\'t contain any preservatives. you can use this flour for bread machine baking too and it produces superior results. i\\'ve used the recipe on the back of the bag and adapted it by using a mixture of whole wheat and regular bread flour because i didn\\'t have any \"gluten\" as called for in the recipe. if you substitute 1 Â½ cups of regular bread flour for part of the whole wheat flour you don\\'t seem to need the gluten.<br /><br />bob\\'s red mill products remind me of my childhood when my father took me to the graue mill in oakbrook, il where we watched corn being milled. it is now the only operating waterwheel gristmill in illinois. while bob\\'s red mill products don\\'t arrive in a cloth bag, the paper bags do have an old fashioned feel and have a string-sewn closure. i love the crinkly sound of the high-quality paper bags.<br /><br />bob\\'s red mill uses slow turning, 100-year-old millstones to naturally grind together the bran, endosperm and germ that contains the nutritious oil. this is a \"cool stone grinding process\" which preserves nutrients normally lost in high-speed, high-heat milling.<br /><br />this company produces more than 400 products. look for everything from hot cereals and mixes to flour milled from a wide variety of grains. if you love making natural breads in your bread machine, the flours are superior and produce deliciously nutritious breads.<br /><br />whole wheat oat rolls<br /><br />1 c. water, warmed to 110Â°f<br />5 t. fat-free milk powder<br />2 t. clover honey<br />2 t. salted butter, melted<br />2 1/2 tsp. active dry yeast<br />1 lg. egg<br />2 c. bread flour<br />1 c. bob\\'s red mill whole-wheat flour<br />1/2 c. bob\\'s red mill thick-rolled oats<br />2 t. wheat germ<br />1 1/2 tsp. salt<br />melted butter<br />oats<br /><br />the dough may be made in a bread machine or by hand. bread machine method: place the water, milk powder, honey, melted butter, yeast, egg, bread<br />flour, whole-wheat flour, oats, wheat germ and salt into a bread machine pan. set bread machine for whole wheat, dough and large loaf cycle. form rolls.<br />hand method: in a large bowl, whisk the water, milk powder, honey, melted butter, yeast and egg. in an extra large bowl, mix the flour, whole wheat flour,<br />oats, wheat germ and salt. stir in the yeast mixture.<br /><br />place dough on a well-floured breadboard. knead until smooth and elastic. place in an oiled bowl, turn once, then cover with a damp cloth. turn oven on to 200Â°f, when you can feel the heat on your hand, turn the oven off. place bowl in the warm oven and let the dough rise until double.<br /><br />punch the dough down and cut into 16 pieces. form rolls then brush with melted butter. sprinkle the tops of the rolls with the oats. let rise for 45 minutes or until double then bake in a preheated 400Â°f oven 10-15 minutes or until lightly browned.<br /><br />makes 16 rolls<br /><br />~the rebecca review',\n",

       " 'you have heard the story about how the baby ruth candy bear was not named for babe ruth but for ruth cleveland, daughter of president grover cleveland.  well, sorry to disappoint you, but that story is not true.  the first baby ruth bars were made by the curtiss candy company, which was founded in chicago in 1916 by otto schnering, who used his mother\\'s maiden name since it was much more american-sounding and would not cause the problems that a german surname would during world war i.  the first confection made by curtiss was the kandy kate, which featured a pastry center topped with nuts and coated with chocolate.  then in 1921 revised the product so that was now a log-shaped bar made of caramel and peanuts, covered in chocolate.  priced at only five cents, half the cost of competing candy bars, schnering named it the baby ruth bar, which soon became one of the hottest selling candies on the market.<br /><br />now, the explanation that the candy bar was named for \"baby\" ruth cleveland, the former president\\'s first-born daughter, has been the official explanation proffered by the curtiss candy company since the 1920\\'s while the babe ruth legend has been the obvious explanation, especially since ruth had joine the yankees in 1920 and in 1921, the year the baby ruth debuted, he hit a then-record 59 home runs.  however, the idea that the baby ruth bar was named after ruth cleveland is rather morbid given she died of diptheria at the age of 12 in 1904, seventeen years before the candy bar was named.<br /><br />the more reasonable explanation seems that the curtiss candy company did indeed find a way to link their product to the yankee slugger who was becoming the most famous person in the country.  ironically, curtiss had to fight off a challenge from a competitor who was attempting to market the babe ruth home run bar, endorsed by the babe himself.  the curtiss claim that the bar was named for ruth cleveland was enough to fight off the challenge, since the names were too close to one another to allow the new product to be marketed that way.  the fact that curtiss maintained for years that the baby ruth bar came out before years before babe ruth became famous is enough to pop the balloon since in 1920 ruth had broken his single season home run record of 29 by hitting 54 round trippers.<br /><br />of course all that matters now is that this is still a classic american candy bar.  beneath the milk chocolate coating of nestles popular 2.1 ounce candy bar is a chewy, peanut-covered center, wrapped in a nougat that is really more of a white or blonde fudge.  in terms of caloric ration the baby ruth is 46% carbs, 48% fats, and 6% protein.  the candy bar is low in sodium and very low in cholesterol, which is good, but high in saturated fat, which is supposedly bad (where do people think the taste comes from?).  a large portion of the calories come from the sugars, which is how nature intended it.  if you want a candy bar with actual peanuts in it, the baby ruth is still a good choice.<br /><br />ironically, i did find a champion cocker spaniel named baby ruth, whelped in 1892, who was in all probability actually named for president cleveland\\'s daughter, ruth, who had been the first child to be born in the white house the previous year.  she was bred by joseph smith of canada and sold to andrew laidlaw and became the foundation on which mepal built one of the strongest kennels in the united states.  all three best in show cocker spaniels at the westminster dog show could trace their pedigree back to this particular baby ruth.',\n",

(1976) and grand theft auto (1977), (most likely due to the fact that they probably had great difficulty in breaking out of the roles they played as children) to name a couple, and while brother ron used the opportunity to get into directing (he directed the latter of the two films mentioned), his brother clint seemed content to keep working in front of the cameras, enjoying his status of forever the character actor dwelling on the hollywood fringe, managing to develop a long, successful career out of it, even making supporting appearances in some of his brothers films (ahhh, sweet nepotism), like far and away (1992), apollo 13 (1995), and edtv (1999), but his destiny seems to lie in the world of the b movie, and it seems to fit him perfectly.<br /><br />in this film, clint plays stanley coopersmith, a cadet at a military school.  stanley possesses an above average iq, is odd looking, an orphan, a loner, and is highly uncoordinated (his fumbling of the ball during the school's soccer matches leads to much angering of the other players along with the coach).  all of these things add up to incessant picking on by a popular clique led by bubba (played by don stark, whom i recognized but couldn't place until i read that he currently appears on the tv show that 70's show as the goofy neighbor bob pinciotti...man, he's really changed, and not for the better).  they harass stanley constantly, playing all sorts of pranks on him and just making his life miserable.  stanley is also harassed by others, like his soccer coach, the school's commandant, and even the school's priest, to some degree.  what's a nerd to do?  well, the answer comes one day while stanley is cleaning the basement of the school's church as punishment, which happens to have some secret catacombs as the current church sits atop a much older church erected by people cast out of their homeland so many hundreds of years ago and left on the shores of america for their heresy in following religions darker path.  stanley finds a secret room, which contains many things, including a dark tome, spelling out rituals of evil and instructions on performing black mass.  with the help of an apple computer borrowed from the school's library, stanley intends on calling up dark powers to aid him in dealing with his tormentors, but will he get more than he bargained for?  you bet he will...<br /><br />clint is always fun to watch, and he doesn't disappoint here.  turning to the dark side to gain supernatural powers to use against my enemies wouldn't have been my first choice, but to each his own.  the story itself is pretty solid, despite various plot holes, and moves along at a steady pace, keeping the viewer's interest throughout until the film's end.  there is a pretty good heaping of gore and nastiness, specifically near the end of the film, along with a couple of scenes with nekkid women (the scene with the secretary taking a shower seemed a bit odd, as she appeared to have a problem with one of her milk glands, as if it was partially deflated somehow, but i digress).  one thing i found interesting was the level of revenge exacted on stanley's tormentors seemed proportional to the amount of harassment they inflicted on him.  decapitations, death by possessed pig, removal of vital organs, etc., it's here and more.  clint is backed up by a rich supporting cast, including veteran film and television actors r.g. armstrong (race with the devil), joseph cortese (american history x), claude earl jones (used cars), heywood nelson (dwayne from the tv show what's happening!), and charles tyner (the outlaw josey wales).  probably the element that will put people off most is the exceptionally cheap looking animated graphics supposed to simulate on screen computer graphics, but i found it kind of charming, in its' own cheesy way.  the film's not really scary, but it does get pretty graphic, and those with a weak stomach would probably do well to avoid this film.<br /><br />this release from anchor bay entertainment boasts a restored and uncut version of the film, which means some of the more gory and graphic scenes of bloody carnage removed due to the mpaa's (motion picture association of america) ever changing archaic rules and regulations (this is the group that gave the film midnight cowboy, which later won the oscar for best picture, an unnecessary x rating at the time of its' release) have been put back in...this is one of my favorite aspects about the dvd format, being the opportunity to see movies as they were originally intended to be seen, before they were hacked up in an effort to satisfy some pain in the rear censorship board.  the special features contained on this release include a good-looking wide screen format (some scratches are present), an entertaining audio commentary by writer/producer/director eric weston, a production cast member named warren lewis, and star clint howard, a original theatrical trailer, biographies, a photo gallery, and booklet insert with liner notes.  if i learned anything from this film, it's that it's not unusual for a military academy to keep a stall of pigs on premises.  it certainly serves a purpose as you can have your underachieving cadets clean the pen as a form of punishment, allowing for a less than surefooted victim to slip and fall into all sorts of nastiness...pig guano...ewwwww...overall, this is a three star film with an extra star for the special features.<br /><br />cookieman108<br /><br />ps...look for richard moll, bull on tv's night court, as father esteban...\",\n",

       " 'given this blend\\'s orgin, the name \"english\" breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a scotsman - a 19th century edinburgh tea master named drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name \"breakfast tea.\" it proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over britain, many of which then added the word \"english,\" which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />english breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them india, sri lanka, kenya, malawi and china. stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy english breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason english breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. it is certainly less refined than darjeeling or even earl grey, but hard to beat as an everyday \"work horse,\" and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee.',\n",

       " 'the history of soft drinks goes all the way back to the mineral water found in natural springs.  the first marketed (non-carbonated) soft drinks, made from water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, appeared in the 17th century. the first drinkable manmade glass of carbonated water was created by an englishmen, dr. joseph priestley, nine years before the declaration of independence.  in 1832, john mathews invented an apparatus for making carbonated water.  the drinking of natural (or even artificial) mineral water was considered a healthy practice so american pharmacists were adding medicinal and other flavorful herbs (birch bark, sarsaparilla, fruit extracts) to unflavored beverage from their soda fountains.  then their customers wanted to start taking the drinks home with them and thus the soft drink bottling industry was born, leading eventually to \"rock and roller cola wars.\"<br /><br />in 1893 in new bern, north carolina, a young pharmacist named caleb bradham began experimenting with a wide variety of different soft drink concoctions that friends and patrons could try out at his drugstore soda fountain.  five year\\'s later the most popular formulation, known as \"brad\\'s drink,\" a combination of carbonated water, sugar, vanilla, rare oils and cola nuts, is named pepsi-cola and in 1902 the company was incorporated.  the product was sold with the slogan: \"exhilarating, invigorating, aids digestion.\"  by 1995 the company\\'s slogan was \"nothing else is a pepsi.\"  pepsico.\\'s restaurant division, tircon global restaurants, inc., which includes pizza hut, taco bell, & kfc, is the largest restaurant company in the world in terms of units and second-largest in sales (go ahead and guess who is bigger and what cola they happen to sell).<br /><br />here we have 144 fluid ounces of pepsi cola divided into a dozen 12 ounce cans as the \"6-pack\" goes the way of the nickle bottle of pepsi.  today, pepsi is a concoction of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid and natural flavors.  the high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar part has me puzzled, simply because i would think that once a corporation has a major formula they do not mess with it in any way shape or form.  so now i am wondering if the taste difference between high fructose corn syrup based pepsi cola and sugar based pepsi cola is as significant as the difference between soda fountain pepsi cola and pepsi cola in a can (the latter is better).  in addition to the 150 calories per 12 fluid ounce serving you get the following percentage daily values (based on a 2,000 calorie diet):<br /><br />total fat (0g) 0%<br />sodium (35 mg) 1%<br />potassium (10 mg)<br />total carbohydrates (41 g of sugars)  14%<br />protein (0 g) 0%<br /><br />there is also 25 mg of caffeine, a fact that is not included in the nutrition facts on the side of the can, which i find interesting because i know i am not alone in drinking pepsi for the caffeine instead of the sodium or sugars.  but i also know that i like the sweeter more refreshing taste of pepsi as compared to the competition (bill cosby once dismissed the idea that we wanted cola with a \"sweeter\" taste, but he was wrong).<br /><br />when i was in england several years ago i saw a whole bunch of ad posters in which things that were traditionally red over there, such as mailboxes and phone booths, were suddenly blue.  of course i now know this was in anticipation of pepsi going from white cans to blue cans.  you might wonder how much money was spent to determine that blue versus red was a better marketing position than white versus red, but when you are going up against a product whose brand name has become the generic name for cola, you need to look for every marketing opportunity.<br /><br />for most of us the history of pepsi is found not in the can (or the bottle), but the advertising slogans.  see how far back in history you can go down this trip along memory lane: \"be young. have fun. drink pepsi\" (1993), \"choice of a new generation\" (1992), \"you got the right one baby\" (1990), \"the choice of a new generation\" (1984), \"have a pepsi day!\" (1976), \"pepsi generation\" (1962), \"now it\\'s pepsi, for those who think young\" (1960), \"the light refreshment\" (1953), \"bigger drink, better taste\" (1943), \"drink pepsi-cola, it will satisfy you\" (1920), and \"the original food drink\" (1906).',\n",

       " \"it absolutely amazes me that some people spend over two dollars for a single cup of coffee, yet still buy those low cost tea bags from the grocery store, and then claim to like coffee better.  many people have not tasted a real good cup of tea.  good tea does not come in a 200 count per cardboard box - the tea should have higher quality and shouldn't be in a cheap cardboard box at all.  it should be in a sealed tin or packed in an airtight bag in order to preserve the flavor, and the leaves should be specially selected.  the cheapest teas are bought in bulk from the lowest quality teas parts of the tea leaf.  yes, cost does matter in tea, just like coffee.<br /><br />unless you're really lazy (which, i admit, i am), teas should also never, ever, be served from a bag.  teas should be in loose form, not confined in a bag.  why?  because tea leaves need to expand in the water to release their full flavor.  you can buy loose tea leaves buy on amazon, high end grocery store, or in specially markets (e.g. cost plus), or tea shoppes.<br /><br />now, unless you want to brew a whole pot with tea leaves in the plot, there are not many ways to make tea right for just one person.  this mug solve the single serving dilemma.  it's big, sturdy, and made of glass.  the most important thing though is that it comes with an infuser.  it looks like a cylindrical filter that is placed into the mug.  just spoon a bit of the tea into the filter, dunk in the mug, and the tea will be brewed right then and there.  the result is some of the best tea you'll have ever drank.  the brewing is really easy, add tea to the filter, and add sub boiling hot water, wait, remove the infuser, and drink.  if you need to add sugar or cream, well, that's your choice, but i believe the right tea needs none of that.<br /><br />to make tea, place one to two spoonfuls in the filter, then pour in 160 degree water for green, steeped for a little less than 2 minutes, 180 degrees for white tea, steeped for over 5 minutes, and about 200 degrees for black or oolong, steeped for about three to four minutes.  no - you don't have to measure the temperature each time, only when first starting out.  just bring the water to boiling, then let it cool down  until the desired temperature is reached.  count those seconds.  next time you make tea, boil, wait for those amount of seconds and then pour in the mug.  easy.<br /><br />i suggest trying different teas (without adding anything), until you find your right one.  my personal favorite is green well green tea, but i still have a lot to try.<br /><br />tea is like wine, cheese, coffee, or beer.  quality and tastes vary tremendously, and if you only try the cheap stuff, you'll never really enjoy it like you should.\",\n",

       " 'earl grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. the biggest secret with this tea once given to earl grey of hoswick hall (british prime minister in 1830 - 1834) by a chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to south vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe\\'s original ingredient). using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea\\'s natural flavor - but with twinings you just can\\'t go wrong, because the original earl grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his chinese friend.<br /><br />(from the twinings website: \"when the mandarin\\'s tasty gift began to run out, earl grey asked his tea merchants, twinings, to match it for him. twinings unique blend was the grey family\\'s long-standing favourite. when guests inquired about it, they were directed to twinings on the strand, where they would ask for earl grey\\'s tea by name.\")<br /><br />unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, i recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend\\'s particular flavor.

       " 'gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named pingshui in the eastern chinese province of zhejiang, south of the yangtse river delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the \"green pearl\" of tea. pingshui tea market records date as far back as the tang dynasty (ad 618 - 907). the area\\'s gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between china and the west it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in europe. particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the london market was second only to then-popular wu yi oolong (also from china). even today, zhejiang province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />the name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea\\'s elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. it should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.',\n",

       " 'it was in the 1920s that the h.b. reese candy company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and hershey\\'s milk chocolate. back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as reese\\'s peanut butter cups. harry burnett reese was actually a former dairy employee of milton s. hershey, the founder of the hershey foods corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. reese made a lot of other products, such as johnny bars (caramel-like molasses) and lizzie bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />in the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of hershey, reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. in the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. during world war ii reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. after world war ii the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. in 1963 the h.b. reese candy company, inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the hershey chocolate company, and in 1976 the first variation in the reese\\'s peanut butter cup was made with the introduction of reese\\'s crunchy peanut butter cup.<br /><br />in 1992 reese\\'s started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered reese\\'s bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched reesesticks to go along with the fastbreak, nutrageous, and bites, not to mention peanut butter christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. now even have white chocolate reese\\'s peanut butter cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. but behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original reese\\'s peanut butter cup. there is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. you just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. but it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. or you can buy this 6 pack of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them without resorting to making them.',\n",

       " 'i had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the pet expo in del mar, ca and had noticed how wonderful it smells. the litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. the sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the florida company that produces feline pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the south.<br /><br />i tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. it is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. any \"dust\" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.<br /><br />as the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. i suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. the sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily \"stirring\", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.<br /><br />the only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don\\'t dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. the bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but i think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. the packaging also says \"chemical free...\" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. h2o (water) is a chemical. it should read \"hazardous chemical free\" or \"biotoxin free\".<br /><br />anyway, i\\'ll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. now that i\\'ve tried a premium litter, i\\'ll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best.',\n",

       " 'in 1923 the milky way bar was created with the idea of putting \"a chocolate malted milk in a candy bar\".  the original milky way bar was created in both chocolate and vanilla flavors, even though the latter had a dark bittersweet chocolate coating.  the name was trademarked in 1925 and sold nationally the following year for 5 cents.  in 1932 the 5-cent bar was increased to a two-piece bar and then in 1936 it went back to being a one-piece bar and the vanilla milky way bar was changed to the forever yours bar.  if you were wondering why you do not remember the forever yours bar that was because it was discontinued in 1979, so i would strongly advise against eating any forever yours bars that you might happen to find.  however, in 1989 they came out with the milky way dark bar, which basically had the same ingredients as the forever yours bar, but you should not eat any of those either because in 2000 the milky way dark bar was renamed the milky way midnight bar, because the name change along was seen as a way of increasing sales, so those you can safely eat.  outside of the united states if you want a milky way bar then you just gets a mars bar.<br /><br />a milky way bar is made of chocolate malt-flavored nougat and caramel covered with milk chocolate.  the nougat part is made by whipping egg whites with other ingredients until light and frothy enough to make a frappe.  that is when the cocoa and malt flavorings are added to the frappe to create the candy bar\\'s signature flavor.  as for the wiggly lines on the bottom of the bars, those come from the belt they ride on while cooling.  in 1999, in case you did not notice it, the milky way brand was reformulated and relaunched.  the year before they made over 200 million single size milky way bars produced in the united states, so they decided to change everything, from the packaging, slogan, and advertising (\"milk it!\") to the taste.  the milky way bar saw a 20% increase in the caramel and the chocolate was made chunkier (however the milky way dark bar that is now the milky way midnight bar had its caramel increased by only 10%).  today the slogan for milky way is \"pleasure you can\\'t measure.\"<br /><br />the ingredients in a milky way bar are milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk, chocolate, lactose, milk fat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor), corn syrup, sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, skim milk, less than 2% milk fat, cocoa powder processed with alkali, lactose, malted barley, wheat flour, salt, egg whites, artificial flavor.  each milky way bar is 2.05 oz (58.12 g) and has 270 calories, of which 90 are calories from fat (which is not as bad as it sounds).  the product is gluten free but is only kosher certified in the celebrations package.  the key thing here is the taste, which combines milk chocolate with creamy caramel and fluffy nougat into a pretty sweet tasting candy bar.',\n",

       " \"i really do like my senseo coffee maker.  i, like others who have reviewed the kona pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. i was excited to see that kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'.  i have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.<br /><br />after reading some of the reviews here, i could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable.  it just didn't make sense.  well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee i made using the kona pods also.<br /><br />my results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the kona pods cost a lot more than folgers or other pod brands that i can buy locally. the first thing i noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod i have ever used in my senseo.  the instructions for the kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine.  the kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package.  i always  wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the senseo. after my problems with the kona pods, my husband decided that i was not 'wiggling' them enough.  he promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open.  so, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine.<br /><br />the first thing that i noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods.  that did not make much sense, but after several cups of kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods.  the best i can figure out is that the kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water.  there is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done.  the pod itself is heavier when i take it out to throw it away.  so, i believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.<br /><br />then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the kona pods.  the problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the kona pods during the brewing cycle. the 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water!  this problem is one that i still cannot really figure out.  the kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods i have tried.  so, i guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee.  i also wonder if the paper filter of the kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate.  i have tried wetting the kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod.  but, that has not worked for me.<br /><br />so, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me.  i have wasted too many expensive kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. even when the kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as i get using other brands.  so, adding the cost of the kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work.<br /><br />i have been reading of a product called an ecopod.  it is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers.  it might be the next thing i try.\",\n",

it turns out that the academy sits on the very site where esteban and his followers established a church devoted to satan. stanley\\'s discovery is in actuality esteban\\'s old haunt. our hero finds a book written in latin containing many conjurations and dark prayers, and it isn\\'t too long before he\\'s entering all of this stuff into his computer in an effort to discover what it means. meanwhile, the torment continues. bubba and his fellow goons destroy stanley\\'s class project, and physically assault him in the corridors every chance they get. kincaid administers a whipping, and jameson can barely look at the boy without cringing. coopersmith\\'s dark discoveries soon take on a vengeful tone as he begins actively collecting the necessary materials to cast a spell against his tormenters. the final straw occurs when bubba and his friends perform an act so despicable against the only thing coopersmith cares about in the entire world. from this point forward the gloves are off as \"evilspeak\" turns into an unmitigated gorefest of epic proportions. note to self: never pick on anyone again. ever.<br /><br />\"evilspeak\" never lets us forget that clint howard is the star of the film. the camera rarely leaves him, which is a good thing because we see what a fine actor he is. howard gives his put upon character great depth, makes us believe totally that he\\'s a rather inept kid with a penchant for clumsiness yet deep inside is a good guy just looking to improve his lot in life. stanley coopersmith is so harassed that you can\\'t help but root for him. perhaps i should compliment the other actors at this point as well because they come across as the most unlikable bunch of cretins in b movie history, and that is exactly what the script called for them to do. i cheered at the end as coopersmith took gory revenge against his oppressors. speaking of the gore, \"evilspeak\" contains several scenes of carnage and general mayhem rarely witnessed in american horror films. the pigs paying a visit to the secretary at her home should win some sort of award, but the real gooey stuff appears at the end. imagine an airborne clint howard in devilish makeup slicing through heads and limbs with an enormous sword. yep, it\\'s gory, it\\'s gluey, and it\\'s great.<br /><br />a huge thanks goes out to anchor bay for releasing such a fine dvd version of the film. extras include a commentary with howard and director eric weston, poster stills, and a trailer. the commentary is a lot of fun due to clint howard\\'s observations. he tells lots of great stories, including one about some problems he encountered with law enforcement when he wore his military uniform from the film to a las vegas casino several years later. clint seems like a great guy and his enthusiasm for the film appears genuine. weston and howard even discuss the idea of making a sequel! it probably won\\'t happen, but if it matches this film in the gore department i\\'ll be the first one in line to see it.',\n",

       " 'some of us should be warned about two important facts about this annie\\'s product:<br /><br />1. it is made from organic, white cheddar cheese.<br /><br />2. these are shells, not macaroni.<br /><br />point number one is very important. not just because the cheese is organic (organic pastuerized milk, salt, enzymes), although that is very important to some people. no, it is mentioned here because some purists will eat only yellow cheddar cheese. white cheddar cheese makes white cheddar cheese sauce, and together they make something to eat with the color of white cheddar cheese. therefore, this will look white--not snow white--but a soft creamy white, and some people (who will not be mentioned here) insist on yellow. often this is a bright, unrealistic looking yellow, almost like it\\'s radioactive, but i am not one to judge.<br /><br />the second thing to know is that the noodle-like things covered with the white cheddar cheese sauce are not macaroni. (as in \"stuck a feather in his hat and called it...\") these are \"shells.\" they resemble some sea shells, like the kind that pagoo the hermit climbed into in that book, or like the rounded shells--only smaller--that you can put up to your ear and supposedly you can then hear almost anything, like even something happening in new york or france. again, these are not macaroni, and this is important because there are some people who will eat only the little tubes known as macaroni.<br /><br />if you are ok with this, then you\\'re in luck, and you don\\'t need to look any further for a good lunch, dinner, or after play snack (or school, if you go to school). annie\\'s is like that other big company\\'s product (annie\\'s is number two), where you boil and drain the macaroni (although here we have shells, not macaroni), and then mix in the dry sauce, maybe adding some milk or butter. \"season to taste.\"<br /><br />the actual, official, ingredients include the following:<br />organic durum semolina pasta (organic durum semolina, water), organic white cheddar cheese (organic cultured pasteurized milk, salt, enzymes), whey, salt. these are all vegetarian.<br /><br />one more thing is that for information, games, links to \"arthur,\" and more about the company, visit www.annies.com. according to the website, annie\\'s is available in every state, and now has \"a product line that has grown to include 13 different varieties of totally natural macaroni and cheese, annie\\'s now makes five tasty pasta meals, four yummy canned macs, and a microwave macaroni and cheese...\" by the way, the name of the bunny on annie\\'s products is \"bernie.\" i learned that on the website.',\n",

       " 'there are two soft drink giants in north america, and i assume they are the two biggest world-wide, the coca cola company and the pepsi-cola company.  the battle between these two giants has many fields, including fountain drinks, schools, and grocery stores.  at various times the two players have held varying percentages of the market, with coke currently being ascendant.<br /><br />we drank coke in our house from the time i can remember.  there were numerous brands of soft drinks and colas to which i have been exposed, but i have always returned to the original, coca cola.<br /><br />coca cola is more than a soft drink; it is frequently synonymous with america and freedom in many parts of the world.  in fact, you can say that coca cola has become an american icon, though it is available world wide.  coca cola memorabilia has become popular as collectibles, with various items dating back to the first half of the last century going for incredible sums of money.<br /><br />at the core of the company name, the memorabilia and the attributes associated with the name is the product itself, the one and only coca cola.  the product itself started life as a tonic in 1886, growing steadily in popularity and distribution so that it is probably the american brand with the greatest world-wide recognition.<br /><br />the original coke contained sugar and remains a yummy soft drink.  however, for those of us who like the flavor of coke but do not need the calories, diet coke is my preferred alternative.  i remember when i first started drinking diet coke that i had a little bit of difficulty becoming accustomed to the flavor, but now that i have become accustomed to the flavor of diet coke i find the flavor of classic coke to be a little strange.  i drink far more diet coke than classic coke.<br /><br />i think i prefer diet coke over diet pepsi because diet coke has a slightly stronger emphasis on carbonation.  the mild burn as the cold carbonation goes down your throat is somehow enervating and refreshing, and reminds me of good times and good things.  all my associations with diet coke are positive.<br /><br />the 12 can fridge pack is a one of the numerous ways in which diet coke can be purchased.  the biggest advantage to the fridge pack is that it is specifically intended to sit on a refrigerator shelf and be a dispensing unit for cans of diet coke.  the only problem with the fridge pack is that you must remove one can of diet coke when you open the box, so you either have to sit the single can on the shelf or you have to drink it, if you plan on using the box as a dispenser.<br /><br />i still prefer 12 ounce cans over the various other size configurations because i can usually drink an entire can, thus preserving the carbonation and fresh flavor of the drink.  the two liter bottles are fine if you are having a party or drink a lot of diet coke, but it seems to me that as the bottle gets near the bottom the diet coke seems less fresh if the bottle has been around more than a day or two; the same with the 20 ounce bottles, which i am unable to drink in one sitting.<br /><br />diet coke is a personal favorite, even over the original classic coke.  i occasionally will drink another brand for variety or other reasons, but i always come back to the original.  as coke once advertised, \"have a coke and a smile!\"',\n",

       " \"few things i'd like to point out:1.  &quot;espresso&quot; is not a roast.  it's a drink.  in northern italy they make espresso from vienna roast, in southern italy they use french.  starbucks appears to be using french roast, so they should just label it french roast like any normal person would.2.  the product description says &quot;taste espresso roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. this is one versatile coffee!&quot;  this is patently absurd.  it's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  here's why:making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  if you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  if you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  you get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.therefore, a &quot;universal grind&quot; is an impossibility.  they should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.3.  it's over-roasted.  starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  then they roast all their beans vienna or french.  most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not vienna or french.  so why roast all your beans too dark?  i guess it's just easier that way.  also, it lets them rename vienna roast as &quot;starbucks roast&quot; because the austrians don't seem to care.that said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:buy a grinder.  nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  if you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  if you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  it's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for starbucks you should invest in one.find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  freshness matters!  good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  most people don't use the right amount.  if you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.\",\n",

       " \"having received some blue d'auvergne along with several other artisan cheeses this xmas, i was very pleased with the smoothness of this blue. unlike the more famous roquefort, d'auvergne is slightly milder, with less of an after-flavor.  it does not overpower one's tastes and is a good choice for those looking for the strength of a french bleu but wishing to avoid offending delicate palettes.  this cheese is made from sheep's milk and contains the famed veins of blueish bacteria that give the cheese its signature flavor. this blue was not wet nor sticky as many of the trendier blues of late seem to have become. neither has it the overly dry texture of say an english blue stilton, a traditional holiday blue cheese on its own or in combination with the english gloucster cheddar and referred to as &quot;huntsman&quot; cheese, whcih is very pretty, but suitable only as a dessert cheese or for afternoon tea owing to its dryness.blue d'auvergne, on the other hand, has a subtle creamy texture without being overly moist. some bleus err on the side of moistness now to the point of being more similar to a triple-creme.  not so this bleu. d'auvergne slices well with the proper cutlery and can be crumbled if you'd like it that way.  it melted well atop a pear tart we made and complimented the sandy sweetness of the pears wtihout overpowering their delicate flavor &amp; scent as a bleu such as roquefort would have easily done.  this is a fine addition to the french bleus and it was a pleasure to have on hand at a time when rich foods were bieng served and the d'auvergne could be used to sprinkle atop a lightly seared filet mignon with a sultana reduction sauce or tossed into a simple salad of dandilion greens, leftover crushed walnuts,and nasturtium vinegrette. the possibilities are endless.this cheese was not too rich but was just rich enough to enhance any dish it graced. it's light tang was never overpowering, rather it added a gentle dash of excitment to the foods with which we paired it. although there was none left over for a simpler dish, i would have loved to have tried it on its own either with wine or as part of a fruit plate.  i look forward to getting more of this fine cheese.\",\n",

       " 'you have heard the story about how the baby ruth candy bear was not named for babe ruth but for ruth cleveland, daughter of president grover cleveland.  well, sorry to disappoint you, but that story is not true.  the first baby ruth bars were made by the curtiss candy company, which was founded in chicago in 1916 by otto schnering, who used his mother\\'s maiden name since it was much more american-sounding and would not cause the problems that a german surname would during world war i.  the first confection made by curtiss was the kandy kate, which featured a pastry center topped with nuts and coated with chocolate.  then in 1921 revised the product so that was now a log-shaped bar made of caramel and peanuts, covered in chocolate.  priced at only five cents, half the cost of competing candy bars, schnering named it the baby ruth bar, which soon became one of the hottest selling candies on the market.now, the explanation that the candy bar was named for \"baby\" ruth cleveland, the former president\\'s first-born daughter, has been the official explanation proffered by the curtiss candy company since the 1920\\'s while the babe ruth legend has been the obvious explanation, especially since ruth had joine the yankees in 1920 and in 1921, the year the baby ruth debuted, he hit a then-record 59 home runs.  however, the idea that the baby ruth bar was named after ruth cleveland is rather morbid given she died of diptheria at the age of 12 in 1904, seventeen years before the candy bar was named.the more reasonable explanation seems that the curtiss candy company did indeed find a way to link their product to the yankee slugger who was becoming the most famous person in the country.  ironically, curtiss had to fight off a challenge from a competitor who was attempting to market the babe ruth home run bar, endorsed by the babe himself.  the curtiss claim that the bar was named for ruth cleveland was enough to fight off the challenge, since the names were too close to one another to allow the new product to be marketed that way.  the fact that curtiss maintained for years that the baby ruth bar came out before years before babe ruth became famous is enough to pop the balloon since in 1920 ruth had broken his single season home run record of 29 by hitting 54 round trippers.of course all that matters now is that this is still a classic american candy bar.  beneath the milk chocolate coating of nestles popular 2.1 ounce candy bar is a chewy, peanut-covered center, wrapped in a nougat that is really more of a white or blonde fudge.  in terms of caloric ration the baby ruth is 46% carbs, 48% fats, and 6% protein.  the candy bar is low in sodium and very low in cholesterol, which is good, but high in saturated fat, which is supposedly bad (where do people think the taste comes from?).  a large portion of the calories come from the sugars, which is how nature intended it.  if you want a candy bar with actual peanuts in it, the baby ruth is still a good choice.ironically, i did find a champion cocker spaniel named baby ruth, whelped in 1892, who was in all probability actually named for president cleveland\\'s daughter, ruth, who had been the first child to be born in the white house the previous year.  she was bred by joseph smith of canada and sold to andrew laidlaw and became the foundation on which mepal built one of the strongest kennels in the united states.  all three best in show cocker spaniels at the westminster dog show could trace their pedigree back to this particular baby ruth.',\n",

       " \"evilspeak (1982), written and directed by eric weston, features ron howard's lesser known, but more prolific brother clint howard (both started out on the classic television series the andy griffith show, as opie and leon, respectively).  during the 70's, both brothers starred in a spate of schlocky b movies like eat my dust! (1976) and grand theft auto (1977), (most likely due to the fact that they probably had great difficulty in breaking out of the roles they played as children) to name a couple, and while brother ron used the opportunity to get into directing (he directed the latter of the two films mentioned), his brother clint seemed content to keep working in front of the cameras, enjoying his status of forever the character actor dwelling on the hollywood fringe, managing to develop a long, successful career out of it, even making supporting appearances in some of his brothers films (ahhh, sweet nepotism), like far and away (1992), apollo 13 (1995), and edtv (1999), but his destiny seems to lie in the world of the b movie, and it seems to fit him perfectly.in this film, clint plays stanley coopersmith, a cadet at a military school.  stanley possesses an above average iq, is odd looking, an orphan, a loner, and is highly uncoordinated (his fumbling of the ball during the school's soccer matches leads to much angering of the other players along with the coach).  all of these things add up to incessant picking on by a popular clique led by bubba (played by don stark, whom i recognized but couldn't place until i read that he currently appears on the tv show that 70's show as the goofy neighbor bob pinciotti...man, he's really changed, and not for the better).  they harass stanley constantly, playing all sorts of pranks on him and just making his life miserable.  stanley is also harassed by others, like his soccer coach, the school's commandant, and even the school's priest, to some degree.  what's a nerd to do?  well, the answer comes one day while stanley is cleaning the basement of the school's church as punishment, which happens to have some secret catacombs as the current church sits atop a much older church erected by people cast out of their homeland so many hundreds of years ago and left on the shores of america for their heresy in following religions darker path.  stanley finds a secret room, which contains many things, including a dark tome, spelling out rituals of evil and instructions on performing black mass.  with the help of an apple computer borrowed from the school's library, stanley intends on calling up dark powers to aid him in dealing with his tormentors, but will he get more than he bargained for?  you bet he will...clint is always fun to watch, and he doesn't disappoint here.  turning to the dark side to gain supernatural powers to use against my enemies wouldn't have been my first choice, but to each his own.  the story itself is pretty solid, despite various plot holes, and moves along at a steady pace, keeping the viewer's interest throughout until the film's end.  there is a pretty good heaping of gore and nastiness, specifically near the end of the film, along with a couple of scenes with nekkid women (the scene with the secretary taking a shower seemed a bit odd, as she appeared to have a problem with one of her milk glands, as if it was partially deflated somehow, but i digress).  one thing i found interesting was the level of revenge exacted on stanley's tormentors seemed proportional to the amount of harassment they inflicted on him.  decapitations, death by possessed pig, removal of vital organs, etc., it's here and more.  clint is backed up by a rich supporting cast, including veteran film and television actors r.g. armstrong (race with the devil), joseph cortese (american history x), claude earl jones (used cars), heywood nelson (dwayne from the tv show what's happening!), and charles tyner (the outlaw josey wales).  probably the element that will put people off most is the exceptionally cheap looking animated graphics supposed to simulate on screen computer graphics, but i found it kind of charming, in its' own cheesy way.  the film's not really scary, but it does get pretty graphic, and those with a weak stomach would probably do well to avoid this film.this release from anchor bay entertainment boasts a restored and uncut version of the film, which means some of the more gory and graphic scenes of bloody carnage removed due to the mpaa's (motion picture association of america) ever changing archaic rules and regulations (this is the group that gave the film midnight cowboy, which later won the oscar for best picture, an unnecessary x rating at the time of its' release) have been put back in...this is one of my favorite aspects about the dvd format, being the opportunity to see movies as they were originally intended to be seen, before they were hacked up in an effort to satisfy some pain in the rear censorship board.  the special features contained on this release include a good-looking wide screen format (some scratches are present), an entertaining audio commentary by writer/producer/director eric weston, a production cast member named warren lewis, and star clint howard, a original theatrical trailer, biographies, a photo gallery, and booklet insert with liner notes.  if i learned anything from this film, it's that it's not unusual for a military academy to keep a stall of pigs on premises.  it certainly serves a purpose as you can have your underachieving cadets clean the pen as a form of punishment, allowing for a less than surefooted victim to slip and fall into all sorts of nastiness...pig guano...ewwwww...overall, this is a three star film with an extra star for the special features.cookieman108ps...look for richard moll, bull on tv's night court, as father esteban...\",\n",

       " \"i was so skeptical of this product that i had to write a review for the rest of the skeptics. this is a fabulous way to get a european coffee experience at home. i'm not a huge fan of starbucks, i find their coffee too bitter, but like everyone else i truck over there spending close to $4.00 a cup on a specialty latte. this is different. this is like the coffee i had every morning in provence. it has great flavor and the frothy top is something you could never get with your regular coffee maker. i love that i can do one cup at a time, so my coffee isn't sitting on the warming plate losing its flavor until i'm ready for another cup. it froths itself, so you don't have to deal with complicated and hard to clean steaming mechanisms. it takes a minute to boil the water and then less than 30 seconds to fill the cup, which is much quicker than making regular coffee. it is easy to put together, take apart and clean; in fact, when i was comparing the similar-looking mr. coffee and black and decker brands in the store i couldn't get those two models back together after i looked at the pod holder, which cinched the decision for me on the senseo (which has a very simple press-down locking mechanism). i'm so glad!!! i haven't tried the dark roast yet, but we love the medium and the decaf, and the mild is nice for afternoon. i was worried about the cost of the pods until i realized that a bag of 18 is under $4.00, which is like 22 cents a pod. when i balance that against $1.00-$4.00 a cup to get anything remotely similar from a coffeehouse, it seems like the bargain of the century. and i don't have to change out of my pjs! if you are a coffee lover i highly recommend this wonderful, unique machine.\",\n",

       " 'the history of soft drinks goes all the way back to the mineral water found in natural springs.  the first marketed (non-carbonated) soft drinks, made from water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, appeared in the 17th century. the first drinkable manmade glass of carbonated water was created by an englishmen, dr. joseph priestley, nine years before the declaration of independence.  in 1832, john mathews invented an apparatus for making carbonated water.  the drinking of natural (or even artificial) mineral water was considered a healthy practice so american pharmacists were adding medicinal and other flavorful herbs (birch bark, sarsaparilla, fruit extracts) to unflavored beverage from their soda fountains.  then their customers wanted to start taking the drinks home with them and thus the soft drink bottling industry was born, leading eventually to \"rock and roller cola wars.\"in 1893 in new bern, north carolina, a young pharmacist named caleb bradham began experimenting with a wide variety of different soft drink concoctions that friends and patrons could try out at his drugstore soda fountain.  five year\\'s later the most popular formulation, known as \"brad\\'s drink,\" a combination of carbonated water, sugar, vanilla, rare oils and cola nuts, is named pepsi-cola and in 1902 the company was incorporated.  the product was sold with the slogan: \"exhilarating, invigorating, aids digestion.\"  by 1995 the company\\'s slogan was \"nothing else is a pepsi.\"  pepsico.\\'s restaurant division, tircon global restaurants, inc., which includes pizza hut, taco bell, & kfc, is the largest restaurant company in the world in terms of units and second-largest in sales (go ahead and guess who is bigger and what cola they happen to sell).here we have 144 fluid ounces of pepsi cola divided into a dozen 12 ounce cans as the \"6-pack\" goes the way of the nickle bottle of pepsi.  today, pepsi is a concoction of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid and natural flavors.  the high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar part has me puzzled, simply because i would think that once a corporation has a major formula they do not mess with it in any way shape or form.  so now i am wondering if the taste difference between high fructose corn syrup based pepsi cola and sugar based pepsi cola is as significant as the difference between soda fountain pepsi cola and pepsi cola in a can (the latter is better).  in addition to the 150 calories per 12 fluid ounce serving you get the following percentage daily values (based on a 2,000 calorie diet):total fat (0g) 0%sodium (35 mg) 1%potassium (10 mg)total carbohydrates (41 g of sugars)  14%protein (0 g) 0%there is also 25 mg of caffeine, a fact that is not included in the nutrition facts on the side of the can, which i find interesting because i know i am not alone in drinking pepsi for the caffeine instead of the sodium or sugars.  but i also know that i like the sweeter more refreshing taste of pepsi as compared to the competition (bill cosby once dismissed the idea that we wanted cola with a \"sweeter\" taste, but he was wrong).when i was in england several years ago i saw a whole bunch of ad posters in which things that were traditionally red over there, such as mailboxes and phone booths, were suddenly blue.  of course i now know this was in anticipation of pepsi going from white cans to blue cans.  you might wonder how much money was spent to determine that blue versus red was a better marketing position than white versus red, but when you are going up against a product whose brand name has become the generic name for cola, you need to look for every marketing opportunity.for most of us the history of pepsi is found not in the can (or the bottle), but the advertising slogans.  see how far back in history you can go down this trip along memory lane: \"be young. have fun. drink pepsi\" (1993), \"choice of a new generation\" (1992), \"you got the right one baby\" (1990), \"the choice of a new generation\" (1984), \"have a pepsi day!\" (1976), \"pepsi generation\" (1962), \"now it\\'s pepsi, for those who think young\" (1960), \"the light refreshment\" (1953), \"bigger drink, better taste\" (1943), \"drink pepsi-cola, it will satisfy you\" (1920), and \"the original food drink\" (1906).',\n",

       " 'it was in the 1920s that the h.b. reese candy company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and hershey\\'s milk chocolate. back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as reese\\'s peanut butter cups. harry burnett reese was actually a former dairy employee of milton s. hershey, the founder of the hershey foods corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. reese made a lot of other products, such as johnny bars (caramel-like molasses) and lizzie bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.in the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of hershey, reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. in the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. during world war ii reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. after world war ii the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. in 1963 the h.b. reese candy company, inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the hershey chocolate company, and in 1976 the first variation in the reese\\'s peanut butter cup was made with the introduction of reese\\'s crunchy peanut butter cup.in 1992 reese\\'s started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered reese\\'s bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched reesesticks to go along with the fastbreak, nutrageous, and bites, not to mention peanut butter christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. now even have white chocolate reese\\'s peanut butter cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. but behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original reese\\'s peanut butter cup. there is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. you just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. but it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. or you can buy this pair of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them. fortunately this is a 2 cup packages, because my way of eating reese\\'s peanut butter cups is to eat them all. open up a wrapper with four cups, i eat four. open up a wrapper with two cups, i eat two. you do not want to enjoy too much of a good thing when it comes to candy.',\n",

       " \"it absolutely amazes me that some people spend over two dollars for a single cup of coffee, yet still buy those low cost tea bags from the grocery store, and then claim to like coffee better.  many people have not tasted a real good cup of tea.  good tea does not come in a 200 count per cardboard box - the tea should have higher quality and shouldn't be in a cheap cardboard box at all.  it should be in a sealed tin or packed in an airtight bag in order to preserve the flavor, and the leaves should be specially selected.  the cheapest teas are bought in bulk from the lowest quality teas parts of the tea leaf.  yes, cost does matter in tea, just like coffee.unless you're really lazy (which, i admit, i am), teas should also never, ever, be served from a bag.  teas should be in loose form, not confined in a bag.  why?  because tea leaves need to expand in the water to release their full flavor.  you can buy loose tea leaves buy on amazon, high end grocery store, or in specially markets (e.g. cost plus), or tea shoppes.now, unless you want to brew a whole pot with tea leaves in the plot, there are not many ways to make tea right for just one person.  this mug solve the single serving dilemma.  it's big, sturdy, and made of glass.  the most important thing though is that it comes with an infuser.  it looks like a cylindrical filter that is placed into the mug.  just spoon a bit of the tea into the filter, dunk in the mug, and the tea will be brewed right then and there.  the result is some of the best tea you'll have ever drank.  the brewing is really easy, add tea to the filter, and add sub boiling hot water, wait, remove the infuser, and drink.  if you need to add sugar or cream, well, that's your choice, but i believe the right tea needs none of that.to make tea, place one to two spoonfuls in the filter, then pour in 160 degree water for green, steeped for a little less than 2 minutes, 180 degrees for white tea, steeped for over 5 minutes, and about 200 degrees for black or oolong, steeped for about three to four minutes.  no - you don't have to measure the temperature each time, only when first starting out.  just bring the water to boiling, then let it cool down  until the desired temperature is reached.  count those seconds.  next time you make tea, boil, wait for those amount of seconds and then pour in the mug.  easy.i suggest trying different teas (without adding anything), until you find your right one.  my personal favorite is green well green tea, but i still have a lot to try.tea is like wine, cheese, coffee, or beer.  quality and tastes vary tremendously, and if you only try the cheap stuff, you'll never really enjoy it like you should.\",\n",

       " 'earl grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. the biggest secret with this tea once given to earl grey of hoswick hall (british prime minister in 1830 - 1834) by a chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to south vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe\\'s original ingredient). using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea\\'s natural flavor - but with twinings you just can\\'t go wrong, because the original earl grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his chinese friend.(from the twinings website: \"when the mandarin\\'s tasty gift began to run out, earl grey asked his tea merchants, twinings, to match it for him. twinings unique blend was the grey family\\'s long-standing favourite. when guests inquired about it, they were directed to twinings on the strand, where they would ask for earl grey\\'s tea by name.\")unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, i recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend\\'s particular flavor.

       " 'it was in the 1920s that the h.b. reese candy company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and hershey\\'s milk chocolate. back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as reese\\'s peanut butter cups. harry burnett reese was actually a former dairy employee of milton s. hershey, the founder of the hershey foods corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. reese made a lot of other products, such as johnny bars (caramel-like molasses) and lizzie bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.in the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of hershey, reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. in the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. during world war ii reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. after world war ii the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. in 1963 the h.b. reese candy company, inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the hershey chocolate company, and in 1976 the first variation in the reese\\'s peanut butter cup was made with the introduction of reese\\'s crunchy peanut butter cup.in 1992 reese\\'s started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered reese\\'s bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched reesesticks to go along with the fastbreak, nutrageous, and bites, not to mention peanut butter christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. now even have white chocolate reese\\'s peanut butter cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. but behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original reese\\'s peanut butter cup. there is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. you just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. but it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. or you can buy this 6 pack of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them without resorting to making them.',\n",

       " 'i had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the pet expo in del mar, ca and had noticed how wonderful it smells. the litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. the sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the florida company that produces feline pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the south.i tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. it is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. any \"dust\" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.as the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. i suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. the sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily \"stirring\", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.the only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don\\'t dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. the bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but i think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. the packaging also says \"chemical free...\" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. h2o (water) is a chemical. it should read \"hazardous chemical free\" or \"biotoxin free\".anyway, i\\'ll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. now that i\\'ve tried a premium litter, i\\'ll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best.',\n",

       " 'in 1923 the milky way bar was created with the idea of putting \"a chocolate malted milk in a candy bar\".  the original milky way bar was created in both chocolate and vanilla flavors, even though the latter had a dark bittersweet chocolate coating.  the name was trademarked in 1925 and sold nationally the following year for 5 cents.  in 1932 the 5-cent bar was increased to a two-piece bar and then in 1936 it went back to being a one-piece bar and the vanilla milky way bar was changed to the forever yours bar.  if you were wondering why you do not remember the forever yours bar that was because it was discontinued in 1979, so i would strongly advise against eating any forever yours bars that you might happen to find.  however, in 1989 they came out with the milky way dark bar, which basically had the same ingredients as the forever yours bar, but you should not eat any of those either because in 2000 the milky way dark bar was renamed the milky way midnight bar, because the name change along was seen as a way of increasing sales, so those you can safely eat.  outside of the united states if you want a milky way bar then you just gets a mars bar.a milky way bar is made of chocolate malt-flavored nougat and caramel covered with milk chocolate.  the nougat part is made by whipping egg whites with other ingredients until light and frothy enough to make a frappe.  that is when the cocoa and malt flavorings are added to the frappe to create the candy bar\\'s signature flavor.  as for the wiggly lines on the bottom of the bars, those come from the belt they ride on while cooling.  in 1999, in case you did not notice it, the milky way brand was reformulated and relaunched.  the year before they made over 200 million single size milky way bars produced in the united states, so they decided to change everything, from the packaging, slogan, and advertising (\"milk it!\") to the taste.  the milky way bar saw a 20% increase in the caramel and the chocolate was made chunkier (however the milky way dark bar that is now the milky way midnight bar had its caramel increased by only 10%).  today the slogan for milky way is \"pleasure you can\\'t measure.\"the ingredients in a milky way bar are milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk, chocolate, lactose, milk fat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor), corn syrup, sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, skim milk, less than 2% milk fat, cocoa powder processed with alkali, lactose, malted barley, wheat flour, salt, egg whites, artificial flavor.  each milky way bar is 2.05 oz (58.12 g) and has 270 calories, of which 90 are calories from fat (which is not as bad as it sounds).  the product is gluten free but is only kosher certified in the celebrations package.  the key thing here is the taste, which combines milk chocolate with creamy caramel and fluffy nougat into a pretty sweet tasting candy bar.',\n",

       " \"i really do like my senseo coffee maker.  i, like others who have reviewed the kona pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. i was excited to see that kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'.  i have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.after reading some of the reviews here, i could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable.  it just didn't make sense.  well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee i made using the kona pods also.my results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the kona pods cost a lot more than folgers or other pod brands that i can buy locally. the first thing i noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod i have ever used in my senseo.  the instructions for the kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine.  the kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package.  i always  wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the senseo. after my problems with the kona pods, my husband decided that i was not 'wiggling' them enough.  he promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open.  so, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine.the first thing that i noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods.  that did not make much sense, but after several cups of kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods.  the best i can figure out is that the kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water.  there is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done.  the pod itself is heavier when i take it out to throw it away.  so, i believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the kona pods.  the problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the kona pods during the brewing cycle. the 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water!  this problem is one that i still cannot really figure out.  the kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods i have tried.  so, i guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee.  i also wonder if the paper filter of the kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate.  i have tried wetting the kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod.  but, that has not worked for me.so, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me.  i have wasted too many expensive kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. even when the kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as i get using other brands.  so, adding the cost of the kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work.i have been reading of a product called an ecopod.  it is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers.  it might be the next thing i try.\",\n",

the movie doesn\\'t spend much time explaining what these folks are doing, but we do see esteban performing some sort of bizarre ritual on the beach immediately before sacrificing a young lady to his dark deities. flash forward to the present--meaning 1981 or 1982--to a soccer game at the west andover military academy. stanley coopersmith (howard) trips at a critical moment and loses the game for the team. the abuse heaped upon this poor lad is extreme. coach (claude earl jones) initially sticks up for coopersmith by telling his teammates that every boy at the academy gets a shot at playing for the school. within seconds of this exclamation, the coach helpfully makes a \"suggestion\" to bubba (don stark) and his pals that if an injury sidelined stanley, there wouldn\\'t be much anyone could do about it. wow, what a bunch of jerks! this is only the beginning, however, as we soon learn that the entire school seems to have it in for this poor kid. colonel kincaid (charles tyner), the commandant of the academy, can\\'t stand him either. neither can reverend jameson (joseph cortese) or the alcoholic caretaker sarge (r.g. armstrong).things start to look up for coopersmith when he discovers a labyrinth of corridors underneath the school. wouldn\\'t you just know it? it turns out that the academy sits on the very site where esteban and his followers established a church devoted to satan. stanley\\'s discovery is in actuality esteban\\'s old haunt. our hero finds a book written in latin containing many conjurations and dark prayers, and it isn\\'t too long before he\\'s entering all of this stuff into his computer in an effort to discover what it means. meanwhile, the torment continues. bubba and his fellow goons destroy stanley\\'s class project, and physically assault him in the corridors every chance they get. kincaid administers a whipping, and jameson can barely look at the boy without cringing. coopersmith\\'s dark discoveries soon take on a vengeful tone as he begins actively collecting the necessary materials to cast a spell against his tormenters. the final straw occurs when bubba and his friends perform an act so despicable against the only thing coopersmith cares about in the entire world. from this point forward the gloves are off as \"evilspeak\" turns into an unmitigated gorefest of epic proportions. note to self: never pick on anyone again. ever.\"evilspeak\" never lets us forget that clint howard is the star of the film. the camera rarely leaves him, which is a good thing because we see what a fine actor he is. howard gives his put upon character great depth, makes us believe totally that he\\'s a rather inept kid with a penchant for clumsiness yet deep inside is a good guy just looking to improve his lot in life. stanley coopersmith is so harassed that you can\\'t help but root for him. perhaps i should compliment the other actors at this point as well because they come across as the most unlikable bunch of cretins in b movie history, and that is exactly what the script called for them to do. i cheered at the end as coopersmith took gory revenge against his oppressors. speaking of the gore, \"evilspeak\" contains several scenes of carnage and general mayhem rarely witnessed in american horror films. the pigs paying a visit to the secretary at her home should win some sort of award, but the real gooey stuff appears at the end. imagine an airborne clint howard in devilish makeup slicing through heads and limbs with an enormous sword. yep, it\\'s gory, it\\'s gluey, and it\\'s great.a huge thanks goes out to anchor bay for releasing such a fine dvd version of the film. extras include a commentary with howard and director eric weston, poster stills, and a trailer. the commentary is a lot of fun due to clint howard\\'s observations. he tells lots of great stories, including one about some problems he encountered with law enforcement when he wore his military uniform from the film to a las vegas casino several years later. clint seems like a great guy and his enthusiasm for the film appears genuine. weston and howard even discuss the idea of making a sequel! it probably won\\'t happen, but if it matches this film in the gore department i\\'ll be the first one in line to see it.',\n",

       " 'some of us should be warned about two important facts about this annie\\'s product:1. it is made from organic, white cheddar cheese.2. these are shells, not macaroni.point number one is very important. not just because the cheese is organic (organic pastuerized milk, salt, enzymes), although that is very important to some people. no, it is mentioned here because some purists will eat only yellow cheddar cheese. white cheddar cheese makes white cheddar cheese sauce, and together they make something to eat with the color of white cheddar cheese. therefore, this will look white--not snow white--but a soft creamy white, and some people (who will not be mentioned here) insist on yellow. often this is a bright, unrealistic looking yellow, almost like it\\'s radioactive, but i am not one to judge.the second thing to know is that the noodle-like things covered with the white cheddar cheese sauce are not macaroni. (as in \"stuck a feather in his hat and called it...\") these are \"shells.\" they resemble some sea shells, like the kind that pagoo the hermit climbed into in that book, or like the rounded shells--only smaller--that you can put up to your ear and supposedly you can then hear almost anything, like even something happening in new york or france. again, these are not macaroni, and this is important because there are some people who will eat only the little tubes known as macaroni.if you are ok with this, then you\\'re in luck, and you don\\'t need to look any further for a good lunch, dinner, or after play snack (or school, if you go to school). annie\\'s is like that other big company\\'s product (annie\\'s is number two), where you boil and drain the macaroni (although here we have shells, not macaroni), and then mix in the dry sauce, maybe adding some milk or butter. \"season to taste.\"the actual, official, ingredients include the following:organic durum semolina pasta (organic durum semolina, water), organic white cheddar cheese (organic cultured pasteurized milk, salt, enzymes), whey, salt. these are all vegetarian.one more thing is that for information, games, links to \"arthur,\" and more about the company, visit www.annies.com. according to the website, annie\\'s is available in every state, and now has \"a product line that has grown to include 13 different varieties of totally natural macaroni and cheese, annie\\'s now makes five tasty pasta meals, four yummy canned macs, and a microwave macaroni and cheese...\" by the way, the name of the bunny on annie\\'s products is \"bernie.\" i learned that on the website.',\n",

(you don't have to refrigerate it, and it tastes better at room temp.)my only complaint -- the mail order wedges are skinny 2/3 oz each, 4 oz per round, 24 oz per 6-round package.  the supermarket wedge is one oz each, 6 oz per round.  watch out if you look at photos, since they incorrectly photograph the larger 6 oz rounds.i bought 2 packages (12 rounds) on thanksgiving and ran out today. i just placed another order. why would anyone pay $40 for 3 pounds of cheese? because i can't find it any cheaper here, and save a lot on shipping by buying two at a time.  if your supermarket carries it, it should be about half that -- you don't have to pay shipping you lucky dog!\",\n",

       " 'there are two soft drink giants in north america, and i assume they are the two biggest world-wide, the coca cola company and the pepsi-cola company.  the battle between these two giants has many fields, including fountain drinks, schools, and grocery stores.  at various times the two players have held varying percentages of the market, with coke currently being ascendant.we drank coke in our house from the time i can remember.  there were numerous brands of soft drinks and colas to which i have been exposed, but i have always returned to the original, coca cola.coca cola is more than a soft drink; it is frequently synonymous with america and freedom in many parts of the world.  in fact, you can say that coca cola has become an american icon, though it is available world wide.  coca cola memorabilia has become popular as collectibles, with various items dating back to the first half of the last century going for incredible sums of money.at the core of the company name, the memorabilia and the attributes associated with the name is the product itself, the one and only coca cola.  the product itself started life as a tonic in 1886, growing steadily in popularity and distribution so that it is probably the american brand with the greatest world-wide recognition.the original coke contained sugar and remains a yummy soft drink.  however, for those of us who like the flavor of coke but do not need the calories, diet coke is my preferred alternative.  i remember when i first started drinking diet coke that i had a little bit of difficulty becoming accustomed to the flavor, but now that i have become accustomed to the flavor of diet coke i find the flavor of classic coke to be a little strange.  i drink far more diet coke than classic coke.i think i prefer diet coke over diet pepsi because diet coke has a slightly stronger emphasis on carbonation.  the mild burn as the cold carbonation goes down your throat is somehow enervating and refreshing, and reminds me of good times and good things.  all my associations with diet coke are positive.the 12 can fridge pack is a one of the numerous ways in which diet coke can be purchased.  the biggest advantage to the fridge pack is that it is specifically intended to sit on a refrigerator shelf and be a dispensing unit for cans of diet coke.  the only problem with the fridge pack is that you must remove one can of diet coke when you open the box, so you either have to sit the single can on the shelf or you have to drink it, if you plan on using the box as a dispenser.i still prefer 12 ounce cans over the various other size configurations because i can usually drink an entire can, thus preserving the carbonation and fresh flavor of the drink.  the two liter bottles are fine if you are having a party or drink a lot of diet coke, but it seems to me that as the bottle gets near the bottom the diet coke seems less fresh if the bottle has been around more than a day or two; the same with the 20 ounce bottles, which i am unable to drink in one sitting.diet coke is a personal favorite, even over the original classic coke.  i occasionally will drink another brand for variety or other reasons, but i always come back to the original.  as coke once advertised, \"have a coke and a smile!\"',\n",

       " \"ok, you have or want a pod machine.  many choices, the senseo is the best of them.  why you want to buy one is likely because you want barista coffee that's easy, cheap, or fast.  the senso does that, but it's not better than espresso.  maybe as good, that's for you to determine.that's the usual tradeoff: fast (easy), cheap, and good: pick any two.  that is my shiny scale (see below).ok, i can pick up these 18-pack pods about $4-5 in the supermarkets.  why pay more with amazon?  you live in alaska or something?if you like the other makers' pods, go ahead and buy them.  i've had the cafe express ones in my senseo, and they work fine.  i've also brewed some bag green tea in it, though it can seep out the sides if you're not careful.  you can not use tamped coffee, however.  tried it, and cleaned up the mess afterward.the purist complaint with the senseo is that their coffees are not up to barista standard.  i don't know who is writing their stuff, but i have been drinking coffee since 9, and i like it so much that my drip brewer sits in the corner.  it's not espresso, but it doesn't' claim to be.  this system is worth more than what i paid for it at costco, which was $40 at xmas.  actually, it was a xmas gift, so technically i didn't buy it.i think the dark roast is better than the medium, but i do like the mild roast when i am in the mood for nothing shocking.  i have tried the flavored coffee, but think i'd rather add flavored syrup.the system brews at 3 bar, or thereabouts, and true espresso machines will be over 7 bar.  also, it's pumping steaming water thru, not just steam, but will produce a very pleasant crema (that oil/coffee foam at the top of the glass).  add milk before, there is no steamer/milk foamer.if you want a real espresso machine, buy a $500 one (rancilio silva is the my recommendation at that price range) and learn how to be a barista (10 hours of practice, working at starbucks, or take a class).  amortize the cost of the machine over 20 years and you'll be wildly happy.  the senseo will likely last 4-5 years, i guess, but if it's for occasional good coffee, better than your drip system can produce, you'll be well pleased.  i recommend it, and i have one.shiny scale:fast/easy: 9good: 7cheap (value): 8and for comparison, the rancilio silva is:fast:easy: 7good: 10\",\n",

comedy gruesome visual effects i m still kind of amazed that it got a pg rating instead of pg and cartoonish slapstick that i really didn t know what to make if it well now that i ve seen it at least

really had some range to him unfortunately he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career however geena davis herself at the cusp of stardom and oscar acclaim is playing

       " 'evilspeak written and directed by eric weston features ron howard s lesser known but more prolific brother clint howard both started out on the classic television series the andy griffith show as opie and leon respectively during the s both brothers starred in a spate of schlocky b movies like eat my dust and grand theft auto most likely due to the fact that they probably had great difficulty in breaking out of the roles they played as children to name a couple and while brother ron used the opportunity to get into directing he directed the latter of the two films mentioned his brother clint seemed content to keep working in front of the cameras enjoying his status of forever the character actor dwelling on the hollywood fringe managing to develop a long successful career out of it even making supporting appearances in some of his brothers films ahhh sweet nepotism like far and away apollo and edtv but his destiny seems to lie in the world of the b movie and it seems to fit him perfectly in this film clint plays stanley coopersmith a cadet at a military school stanley possesses an above average iq is odd looking an orphan a loner and is highly uncoordinated his fumbling of the ball during the school s soccer matches leads to much angering of the other players along with the coach all of these things add up to incessant picking on by a popular clique led by bubba played by don stark whom i recognized but couldn t place until i read that he currently appears on the tv show that s show as the goofy neighbor bob pinciotti man he s really changed and not for the better they harass stanley constantly playing all sorts of pranks on him and just making his life miserable stanley is also harassed by others like his soccer coach the school s commandant and even the school s priest to some degree what s a nerd to do well the answer comes one day while stanley is cleaning the basement of the school s church as punishment which happens to have some secret catacombs as the current church sits atop a much older church erected by people cast out of their homeland so many hundreds of years ago and left on the shores of america for their heresy in following religions darker path stanley finds a secret room which contains many things including a dark tome spelling out rituals of evil and instructions on performing black mass with the help of an apple computer borrowed from the school s library stanley intends on calling up dark powers to aid him in dealing with his tormentors but will he get more than he bargained for you bet he will clint is always fun to watch and he doesn t disappoint here turning to the dark side to gain supernatural powers to use against my enemies wouldn t have been my first choice but to each his own the story itself is pretty solid despite various plot holes and moves along at a steady pace keeping the viewer s interest throughout until the film s end there is a pretty good heaping of gore and nastiness specifically near the end of the film along with a couple of scenes with nekkid women the scene with the secretary taking a shower seemed a bit odd as she appeared to have a problem with one of her milk glands as if it was partially deflated somehow but i digress one thing i found interesting was the level of revenge exacted on stanley s tormentors seemed proportional to the amount of harassment they inflicted on him decapitations death by possessed pig removal of vital organs etc it s here and more clint is backed up by a rich supporting cast including veteran film and television actors r g armstrong race with the devil joseph cortese american history x claude earl jones used cars heywood nelson dwayne from the tv show what s happening and charles tyner the outlaw josey wales probably the element that will put people off most is the exceptionally cheap looking animated graphics supposed to simulate on screen computer graphics but i found it kind of charming in its own cheesy way the film s not really scary but it does get pretty graphic and those with a weak stomach would probably do well to avoid this film this release from anchor bay entertainment boasts a restored and uncut version of the film which means some of the more gory and graphic scenes of bloody carnage removed due to the mpaa s motion picture association of america ever changing archaic rules and regulations this is the group that gave the film midnight cowboy which later won the oscar for best picture an unnecessary x rating at the time of its release have been put back in this is one of my favorite aspects about the dvd format being the opportunity to see movies as they were originally intended to be seen before they were hacked up in an effort to satisfy some pain in the rear

film it s that it s not unusual for a military academy to keep a stall of pigs on premises it certainly serves a purpose as you can have your underachieving cadets clean the pen as a form of

       " 'i really do like my senseo coffee maker i like others who have reviewed the kona pods here was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine i was excited to see that kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a cup style i have not found it to be a huge deal to use smaller cup size pods but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of smaller one after reading some of the reviews here i could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable it just didn t make sense well it still doesn t make sense but it certainly happened with the coffee i made using the kona pods also my results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the kona pods cost a lot more than folgers or other pod brands that i can buy locally the first thing i noticed was that the coffee in the cup sized kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod i have ever used in my senseo the instructions for the kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine the kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package i always wiggled and jiggled the pods for about seconds before putting them in the senseo after my problems with the kona pods my husband decided that i was not wiggling them enough he promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open so there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine the first thing that i noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the kona pod was quite a bit less than when using smaller pods that did not make much sense but after several cups of kona it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using small one cup pods the best i can figure out is that the kona pods themselves seem to hold a lot more water there is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done the pod itself is heavier when i take it out to throw it away so i believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup then as others have mentioned there is the problem that happens to me about the time when using the kona pods the problem is that for whatever reason the water does not actually go through and penetrate the kona pods during the brewing cycle the coffee that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water this problem is one that i still cannot really figure out the kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods i have tried so i guess that somehow the water has enough room to go around the actual pod and come out of the spout without going through the pod to brew coffee i also wonder if the paper filter of the kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate i have tried wetting the kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod but that has not worked for me so it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me i have wasted too many expensive kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them even when the kona pods brew a cup of coffee it is not as large of an amount of coffee as i get using other brands so adding the cost of the kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work i have been reading of a product called an ecopod it is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers it might be the next thing i try ',\n",

including on the waterfront the godfather and apocalypse now who can watch jimmy stewart and not think of it s a wonderful life see what i mean the list could on and on indefinitely the lesser known actors while not as visible to the majority of moviegoers are critical to the success of hollywood because they often take supporting roles that make the leads look good they are recognizable faces to niche film fans however enter clint howard brother of the better known director and actor ron howard horror movie fans will forever pay homage to clint he of the perpetually balding pate goofy visage and lumbering gait for his seminal role of stanley coopersmith in the gorefest evilspeak they will just as likely hold a grudge against him for appearing in uwe boll s atrocious house of the dead but that s another story for another time clint has appeared in dozens of films as well as most of the films lensed by his brother but evilspeak is his defining moment evilspeak opens in the distant past by showing a group of spaniards excommunicating esteban richard moll and his followers from the church for blasphemous activities what sorts of activities the movie doesn t spend much time explaining what these folks are doing but we do see esteban performing some sort of bizarre ritual on the beach immediately before sacrificing a young lady to his dark deities flash forward to the present meaning or to a soccer game at the west andover military academy stanley coopersmith howard trips at a critical moment and loses the game for the team the abuse heaped upon this poor lad is extreme coach claude earl jones initially sticks up for coopersmith by telling his teammates that every boy at the academy gets a shot at playing for the school within seconds of this exclamation the coach helpfully makes a suggestion to bubba don stark and his pals that if an injury sidelined stanley there wouldn t be much anyone could do about it wow what a bunch of jerks this is only the beginning however as we soon learn that the entire school seems to have it in for this poor kid colonel kincaid charles tyner the commandant of the academy can t stand him either neither can reverend jameson joseph cortese or the alcoholic caretaker sarge r g armstrong things start to look up for coopersmith when he discovers a labyrinth of corridors underneath the school wouldn t you just know it it turns out that the academy sits on the very site where esteban and his followers established a church devoted to satan stanley s discovery is in actuality esteban s old haunt our hero finds a book written in latin containing many conjurations and dark prayers and it isn t too long before he s entering all of this stuff into his computer in an effort to discover what it means meanwhile the torment continues bubba and his fellow goons destroy stanley s class project and physically assault him in the corridors every chance they get kincaid administers a whipping and jameson can barely look at the boy without cringing coopersmith s dark discoveries soon take on a vengeful tone as he begins actively collecting the necessary materials to cast a spell against his tormenters the final straw occurs when bubba and his friends perform an act so despicable against the only thing coopersmith cares about in the entire world from this point forward the gloves are off as evilspeak turns into an unmitigated gorefest of epic proportions note to self never pick on anyone again ever evilspeak never lets us forget that clint howard is the star of the film the camera rarely leaves him which is a good thing because we see what a fine actor he is howard gives his put upon character great depth makes us believe totally that he s a rather inept kid with a penchant for clumsiness yet deep inside is a good guy just looking to improve his lot in life stanley coopersmith is so harassed that you can t help but root for him perhaps i should compliment the other actors at this point as well because they come across as the most unlikable bunch of cretins in b movie history and that is exactly what the script called for them to do i cheered at the end as coopersmith took gory revenge against his oppressors speaking of the gore evilspeak contains several scenes of carnage and general mayhem rarely witnessed in american horror films the pigs paying a visit to the secretary at her home should win some sort of award but the real gooey stuff appears at the end imagine an airborne clint howard in devilish makeup slicing through heads and limbs with an enormous sword yep it s gory it s gluey and it s great a huge thanks goes out to anchor bay for releasing such a fine dvd version of the film extras include a commentary with howard and director eric weston poster stills and a trailer the commentary is a lot of fun due to clint howard s observations he tells lots of great stories including one about some problems he encountered with law enforcement when he wore his military uniform from the film to a las vegas casino several years later clint seems like a great guy and his enthusiasm for the film appears genuine weston and howard even discuss the idea of making a sequel it probably won t happen but if it matches this film in the gore department i ll be the first one in line to see it ',\n",

       " 'there are two soft drink giants in north america and i assume they are the two biggest world wide the coca cola company and the pepsi cola company the battle between these two giants has many fields including fountain drinks schools and grocery stores at various times the two players have held varying percentages of the market with coke currently being ascendant we drank coke in our house from the time i can remember there were numerous brands of soft drinks and colas to which i have been exposed but i have always returned to the original coca cola coca cola is more than a soft drink it is frequently synonymous with america and freedom in many parts of the world in fact you can say that coca cola has become an american icon though it is available world wide coca cola memorabilia has become popular as collectibles with various items dating back to the first half of the last century going for incredible sums of money at the core of the company name the memorabilia and the attributes associated with the name is the product itself the one and only coca cola the product itself started life as a tonic in growing steadily in popularity and distribution so that it is probably the american brand with the greatest world wide recognition the original coke contained sugar and remains a yummy soft drink however for those of us who like the flavor of coke but do not need the calories diet coke is my preferred alternative i remember when i first started drinking diet coke that i had a little bit of difficulty becoming accustomed to the flavor but now that i have become accustomed to the flavor of diet coke i find the flavor of classic coke to be a little strange i drink far more diet coke than classic coke i think i prefer diet coke over diet pepsi because diet coke has a slightly stronger emphasis on carbonation the mild burn as the cold carbonation goes down your throat is somehow enervating and refreshing and reminds me of good times and good things all my associations with diet coke are positive the can fridge pack is a one of the numerous ways in which diet coke can be purchased the biggest advantage to the fridge pack is that it is specifically intended to sit on a refrigerator shelf and be a dispensing unit for cans of diet coke the only problem with the fridge pack is that you must remove one can of diet coke when you open the box so you either have to sit the single can on the shelf or you have to drink it if you plan on using the box as a dispenser i still prefer ounce cans over the various other size configurations because i can usually drink an entire can thus preserving the carbonation and fresh flavor of the drink the two liter bottles are fine if you are having a party or drink a lot of diet coke but it seems to me that as the bottle gets near the bottom the diet coke seems less fresh if the bottle has been around more than a day or two the same with the ounce bottles which i am unable to drink in one sitting diet coke is a personal favorite even over the original classic coke i occasionally will drink another brand for variety or other reasons but i always come back to the original as coke once advertised have a coke and a smile ',\n",
